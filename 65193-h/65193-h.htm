</div>


<p>While abundant material has been put before children
with the purpose of making them familiar with the history
and industrial development of various parts of the known
world, very little has been written to inform them of the
work which is now being done in the comparatively unknown
regions of the north, or of the history of the early
discoveries which have led to it.</p>

<p>The importance of the present determined search for
the North Pole is admitted by all thoughtful people, and
the subject is one which must increase in interest until the
entire North Frigid Zone is correctly mapped and charted.</p>

<p>Accounts of the pioneers in this work of discovery, of
Franklin and of Kane, and in our own day of Nansen
and Peary, are available only in such exhaustive works
as are unsuitable reading for children, and which sometimes
tax the patience of the adult. Hence the work done
by these intrepid explorers upon the American continent
and north of it remains unstudied and unknown.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this book may give our young people
sufficient knowledge of the subject to enable them to read
farther with intelligence, and that it may also inspire
them with interest in the many expeditions that are being
sent out.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the strange people who inhabit
these cold countries, their dress, their ways of living,
their customs, and their manners, all interest the child,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>

and meet his natural desire to hear about other people
than those living in the part of the world about him.</p>

<p>No complete history has been attempted, but rather a
series of sketches which, it is hoped, will enable the reader
to appreciate the achievements of the brave men who
have lent and are lending their best efforts to the task
of unlocking and wresting from the Frozen North, the
secrets so necessary for the advancement of science.</p>

<p>The north polar regions lie within the Arctic circle,
and at their center is the North Pole. The distance from
the circle to the pole is more than fourteen hundred miles.
Intense cold and the hardships of ice navigation have made
the discovery and exploration of this region very slow and
hazardous.</p>

<p>It is believed that Norsemen from Norway and Sweden,
after colonizing Iceland, made settlements on the Greenland
coast and carried their seal hunting beyond the Arctic
circle, far into the polar regions. But in 1347 a plague
broke out in Norway, and the people forgot their far-off
colonies. For more than a hundred years after this no
attempt was made to enter the Arctic circle.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that the famous voyage of Columbus
in 1492, although made toward the south, should have
influenced to some extent discovery in the north polar
regions. After Columbus had really proved that the earth
was round, navigators believed that by sailing westward
far enough they might reach the rich lands of India and
Cathay (China).</p>

<p>The only route then known from Europe to India was
through the Mediterranean Sea. At Constantinople, the
cargoes of metals, woods, and pitch were unloaded and sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
on by caravan to the East, while returning caravans brought
silks, dyewoods, spices, perfumes, precious stones, ivory,
and pearls, to be shipped from Constantinople.</p>

<p>When the Turks, through whose country the merchants
passed, began to realize how valuable the Eastern trade
was, they sent bands of robbers to seize the caravans,
making traffic by this route more difficult and more dangerous
as time went on; so that European merchants tried
to find some other way of reaching
that part of the world.</p>

<p>John and Sebastian Cabot, two
English navigators, set out in
1497 to sail westward, but finding
their way blocked by the American
continent, they returned.
In 1498 Sebastian Cabot made a
second voyage, with the object
of finding a passage north of
America which would lead to the
Spice Islands and rich Cathay.
In this way the long hunt for the
northwest passage was begun.</p>

<p>The Cabots did not find the northwest passage; and
though many voyages were made in search of it by other
navigators during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries,
nobody met with success. The severe cold, added to the
difficulties of a voyage through the ice of ages, prevented
further investigation in that direction for some time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Spanish and the Portuguese had been
active in seeking for southern routes to the East, and had
discovered two,—one around the Cape of Good Hope and
one through the Strait of Magellan. They guarded these
waterways jealously, and would not allow the ships of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
other nations to pass. Thus they succeeded in controlling
all the rich Eastern trade, and were growing very wealthy
and powerful.</p>

<p>The English and the Dutch, who were also anxious to
obtain a share of the rich commerce with the East, saw the
importance of finding
a northern route to
India; consequently
they experimented by
sailing northeast
along the coast of
Europe and Asia.
The route which they
sought was known as
the northeast passage.</p>

<p>England sent out the first expedition in 1553, but the severity
of the weather prevented the ships from making much
progress. Several other vain attempts were made by the
English, and then the Dutch took up the work; but they
failed, too, and for a time the search for northern passages
to the Indies was abandoned.</p>

<p>The total absence of the
sun from the Arctic regions
during a large part of each
year makes the climate
severe and the country
desolate. Direct sun rays
are necessary to insure
warmth, and the regions
within the Arctic circle receive at the best only slanting rays.</p>

</div>

<p>In the temperate zones the sun is never exactly overhead.
For people who live within the tropics it is overhead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
twice every year. At all places along the equator
the sun is overhead at noon on the 21st of March. Each
day after, it comes overhead at noon at places farther
north, until the 21st of June, when it is overhead at the
tropic of Cancer. After this the sun appears to turn and
go south, and on September 22 it is again overhead at
noon at the equator. The sun then continues to move
southward each day until December 21, when it is
overhead at the tropic of Capricorn. And so it goes back
and forth the year round.</p>

<p>While the sun is north of the equator, there is constant
day somewhere within the Arctic circle; when the sun is
south of the equator, there is constant night somewhere
within the Arctic circle. The farther a region is from the
equator, the longer are the days and nights at different
seasons of the year. At the pole there is a night of six
months and a day of six months. The night is sometimes
lighted by the moon and sometimes by the aurora borealis.</p>

<p>There are but two seasons in the Arctic regions—a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
long, cold winter and a short, dry summer. It is during
the summer that the explorers do their work. Throughout
the dark winter they can do nothing. Even in the
summer, navigators meet with many perils, for Arctic
navigation is not an easy matter. Besides the danger that
the vessel may be frozen in an ice pack, or crushed between
icebergs, the navigator is often blinded by fogs and snows,
and has to face unknown tides and currents.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Daily Motion of the Heavens as seen at the Equator.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The vegetation within the Arctic circle is scanty. During
the summer the bright, warm sun causes the plants to
spring up and grow rapidly. Willows, dwarf birches, and
rush grasses are plentiful in some localities. In southern
Greenland, and in some sheltered places along its western
coast, yellow poppies and dandelions grow. Farther north
only mosses and lichens are to be found, and beyond the
moss line there is no trace of vegetation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there are plenty of animals in this land of
ice and snow. The polar bear, Arctic fox, blue fox, wolf,
ermine, reindeer, and musk ox are plentiful. Seals and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
walruses come out of the water upon the ice, during the
summer, to enjoy the sun, and thousands of snow buntings,
auks, and eider ducks visit the shores of the cold seas to
build their nests and catch food. When the summer of
three months is over, nearly all outward signs of animal
and vegetable life disappear and the entire landscape becomes
a dreary, white expanse.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this cold land are called Eskimos.
They find it hard to get a living, and their dwellings
are of the rudest and most primitive sort. Many of the
tribes move from place to place, building their snow huts
wherever game is most plentiful, but never going far inland,
because fish forms a large part of their food. The Eskimos
do not mind the bitter weather. They are quite accustomed
to a temperature of 50° below zero.</p>

<p>Within the Arctic circle are two principal areas of great
cold, one in North America and one in Siberia. The mildest
winters are at Bering strait and in the Spitzbergen
Sea, where there is usually open water. The former is
affected by the warm Japan Current and the latter by the
Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>We have as yet learned but little about the icy North.
Nearly three million square miles of our earth lie within the
Arctic circle and are unknown to-day. Much more information
must be gained before man can hope to understand
the physical laws of this mysterious region.</p>

<p>For a century and a half after the sailing ships of the
sixteenth century had failed to find the northern passages
to the East, little was done in the way of Arctic exploration.
The whale and cod fishers were the only navigators who
ventured into the frozen seas. These fishermen carried on
a profitable business in fish and oil. One of them, a Scotch
whaler named William Scoresby, succeeded in driving his
ship as far north as latitude 81° 12ʹ 42ʺ. He spent all the
time that he could spare on this voyage in collecting information
about this unknown part of the earth, and on
his return to England, he told such wonderful stories that
the English people became once more interested in the
frozen North.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in 1815, after England’s wars with the
United States and France were over, the government
offered a reward of £20,000 to any one who would make
the northwest passage, and a reward of £5000 to any one
who would reach 89° north latitude. This offer of prize
money stirred the adventurous blood of seafaring men. In
1818 two expeditions were sent out, and others quickly
followed.</p>

<p>The vast area of unexplored space within the Arctic
circle stimulated men’s imaginations almost as much as
the Western world beyond the Atlantic had done in the
days of Columbus. Many a brave sailor was ready to
undertake the difficult work. Famous among those who
did valuable service was Sir John Franklin.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">II. SIR JOHN FRANKLIN<br />
<small>1818</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sir John Franklin was one of the greatest explorers
the world has ever known. We owe to him most of our
knowledge of the northern
coast of America and of the
far North.</p>

<div class="figright" id="i_009">
  <img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Sir John Franklin.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Franklin was born in 1786
at Spilsby, a small town in
Lincolnshire, England, about
ten miles from the coast.
As a boy, he one day visited
the seaside, which so delighted
him that he then and
there made up his mind to
be a sailor.</p>

<p>Franklin’s parents wished
him to become a clergyman,
and in the hope of curing him of his new passion, they
sent him on a trial voyage. This plan did not succeed, for
the young man learned to love the sea so much that at
last the father yielded to his son’s desire, and obtained
a position for him in the Royal Navy. While in the
navy, John Franklin took part in several of the hardest
naval battles the English ever fought. He made a brilliant
record as a fearless sailor and a wise and determined
leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>After the wars were over, Franklin began the study of
science. But land life was dull for him, and he longed for
the dangers and excitement of the sea. When word came
that he had been chosen by the government to go in search
of the North Pole, he was unspeakably happy. Soon two
strong vessels were ready for the voyage. The command
of the <i>Dorothea</i> was given to Captain Buchan, while Franklin,
with the rank of lieutenant, was put in command of the
<i>Trent</i>. Their orders were to proceed northward between
the islands of Spitzbergen and Greenland, and if they
found the sea free from ice, to push ahead directly for the
North Pole. Should they succeed in finding the pole, they
were, if possible, to return by way of Bering strait, and thus
prove the existence of a northwest passage.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The ships sailed out of the Thames river April 25, 1818.
On May 10 they crossed the Arctic circle, and Franklin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
beheld for the first time the grand spectacle of the midnight
sun. Shortly after the ships had crossed the circle, a terrible
gale arose. The weather was bitterly cold, the snow came
down fast, blinding the eyes of the sailors, and ice covered
the brigs from bow to stern. Every time the bows came up
out of the water a fresh layer of ice was formed upon them,
and the vessels became so heavy that the sailors were obliged
to chop the ice away with axes. The ropes also were frozen
over, and in order to keep them ready for instant use, the
sailors had continually to beat off the ice with sticks. The
ice pack extended on all sides as far as the eye could reach,
and little by little it closed around the ships.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_011">
  <img src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Ship in the Ice Pack.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding this, they managed to enter a bay on
the coast of Spitzbergen, where Captain Buchan decided to
remain until the pack should break up. Neither officers
nor men were idle while at anchor in this bay. Some surveyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the harbor and made a map of it, while others measured
the depth of the water with instruments which they
had brought for that purpose. The magnetic needle was
closely watched, and all its changes noted. Many went
hunting and supplied the crew with meat of the seal and
walrus. Meantime a close watch was kept upon the ice
pack.</p>

<p>Franklin learned to like the rugged Arctic scenery.
Close to the shores of Spitzbergen were long, snow-covered
valleys and high mountains, and between the mountains
stood immense glaciers, glistening in the bright sunlight
which had so little power to melt their surfaces.</p>

<p>One day Buchan and Franklin were in a small boat at
the foot of a glacier. Suddenly they heard a noise like
the report of a great cannon, and looking up, they saw a
portion of the glacier sliding down the mountain side.
This great mass of ice made a grinding noise as it went,
and streams of water flowed after it. At length it plunged
into the sea and disappeared from view. The water was
greatly disturbed and covered with foam. In a few
moments the huge piece of ice rose to the surface and
surged up to a great height above the sea. Then Franklin
and his companion knew how icebergs are formed. This
one was a quarter of a mile around, and rose sixty feet
above the water. It must have weighed millions of tons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_013">
  <img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Icebergs in the Polar Sea.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Franklin was now more anxious than ever to get to the
pole. He knew that thousands of years ago a part of
America and Europe was covered with ice just as the
Arctic regions now are, and he felt sure that if he remained
long enough in this land he would be able to explain many
things heretofore unknown, in regard to climate, soil, tides,
and winds.</p>

<p>Soon the ships, headed toward the north, put to sea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
again, but a furious gale arose, and they were once more
caught in the ice pack. When the wind went down, the
<i>Dorothea</i> was so badly damaged as to be almost unseaworthy,
and Captain Buchan decided to turn back. The
<i>Trent</i> also had been injured, but Franklin tried hard to
induce Captain Buchan to allow him to go northward
alone. Captain Buchan refused, and both vessels accordingly
returned to England, where they arrived safely on
October 12, 1818. We must not regard this expedition
as a failure, even though the pole remained undiscovered,
for Franklin had gained the experience which later enabled
him to accomplish valuable geographical work in the
Arctic regions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">III. FRANKLIN’S FIRST LAND JOURNEY<br />
<small>1819–1821</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next year the British government again decided
to send two ships northward. One of these ships was
put in command of Lieutenant Parry and was ordered to
Lancaster sound. From this place Parry was told to
sail westward and seek the northwest passage. He did
not find the northwest passage, but he succeeded in sailing
inside of the Arctic circle farther west than any one had
gone before. For this achievement he received a prize of
£5000 from the government and on his return to England
was highly honored.</p>

<p>The other expedition was put in command of Sir John
Franklin, who, together with four companions, was to
proceed to Hudson bay on one of the ships belonging to
the Hudson Bay Company. From Hudson bay, Franklin
was to make a land journey by means of sledges and
canoes across the northern part of North America, to the
mouth of the Coppermine river. From this point, he
was to turn and follow the coast of North America east.
The latitude and longitude of various places were to be
noted, maps to be drawn, and capes, bays, and rivers
located and surveyed.</p>

<p>At this time that part of North America which borders
on the Arctic ocean had never been explored. Only two
white men, employees of the Hudson Bay Company, had
ever looked upon this ocean from the continent of North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
America. The first, Samuel Hearne, traveled northward
with the Indians in 1770, and reached the mouth of a large
river which was named the Coppermine, because the Indians
said that large mines of copper were to be found along its
banks.</p>

<p>The second explorer, Alexander Mackenzie, in 1789
traced to its mouth the river which now bears his name.
With the exception of these two river mouths, the entire
northern coast of North America was unknown. The map
which is to-day covered with names of places, was then a
blank.</p>

<p>This was the region which Franklin was to explore.
Many men would dread such a journey, but Franklin liked
it because of the very dangers involved. Dr. John
Richardson, midshipmen Robert Hood and George Back,
and a seaman, John Hepburn, were selected to go with
Franklin on this trip; they were well chosen, for they were
worthy companions of the young leader. On May 23, 1819,
he and his men sailed on the <i>Prince of Wales</i> for the Arctic
land. The voyage was long and stormy; several times it
seemed likely that the <i>Prince of Wales</i> would never touch
land again, but at the end of three months she anchored
off York Factory, on the southern shore of Hudson bay,
one of the posts built by the Hudson Bay Company for
the purpose of trading in furs with the Indians.</p>

<p>The people at York Factory received Franklin and his
companions kindly and helped them all they could. They
gave Franklin a boat for his journey through the lakes
and rivers on his way to the sea. The same sort of boat
is still in use in that region and is called a York boat.
It is forty feet in length, narrow, light, and sharp at both
ends. About ten men can manage it. When on lakes or
traveling down streams the men use oars, but when traveling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
against the current of a river they run alongshore and
drag the boat after them. This long and narrow boat is
well suited for shooting rapids, through which it is guided
by means of long poles. Sometimes the rapids are so swift
that they cannot be navigated, and falls are often encountered.
Then the cargoes are taken out of the boats and
carried around the rapids or falls, and afterward the boats
also are carried around. Such a place is called a portage.</p>

<p>The officers of the Hudson Bay Company, besides giving
Franklin a boat, sent word to other trading posts
throughout the country, to look out for him and to help
him. The party, having secured boats and stores, started
from York Factory to continue their journey. After traveling
seven hundred miles, they reached another post called
Cumberland House, where Franklin expected to find guides
and hunters, but every one refused to undertake a journey
so full of peril.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_017">
  <img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Post of the Hudson Bay Company.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Franklin, though disappointed, was not discouraged.
He left two men at Cumberland House to wait for supplies
and to bring them on. Then, with Back and Hepburn,
he started out with dog sledges for another trading
post on Lake Athabasca. This journey was begun on
January 18, 1820, in the middle of an Arctic winter of
prolonged darkness. The suffering of these three explorers
cannot be described. The temperature fell as low
as 38° below zero, blizzards were common, and the party
nearly perished. On some days the mercury froze in the
thermometers, and the tea froze in the tin pots before it
could be drunk.</p>

<p>At Lake Athabasca Franklin was joined by the men he
had left at Cumberland House. They had secured some
provisions, and now the entire party proceeded down the
Slave river to Great Slave lake. They reached Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Providence, on the northern end of the lake, during
the latter part of July, and in a few days the little company
departed in four canoes, steering northward into a
country which had never before been visited by white men.</p>

<p>Soon Franklin met seventeen canoes filled with Indians,
who had promised to go part of the way with him and
hunt game for his party. They all proceeded together
through a chain of lakes to Winter lake, where they decided
to pass the winter. Here they built a house which
they called Fort Enterprise, and from this place they made
short trips to explore the country northward. One of the
exploring parties reached the source of the Coppermine river.</p>

<p>At first game was plentiful at Fort Enterprise, but as
winter advanced the reindeer left the place, provisions
became scarce, and ammunition was very low. Back offered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
to return to Lake Athabasca for supplies, and Franklin
allowed him to go. He left the party in November, and
they did not see him again until March. He had made a
journey of eleven hundred miles on snowshoes, sleeping
in the shelter of drifts, wrapped in a blanket and a deerskin,
and had sometimes been forced to go without food for two
or three days. But he had saved the party.</p>

<p>When spring came, Franklin and his company started
northward again with two large canoes and several sledges.
They must have “made a record” for slow travel, for each
man had to carry or drag a load of one hundred and eighty
pounds, probably more than the weight of any one of them.
At the Coppermine they launched their canoes, and were
soon shooting dangerous rapids, and carrying their boats
over the portages. Franklin did not stop to search for copper;
he had other aims.</p>

<p>On July 18, 1821, the party reached the mouth of the
Coppermine and camped on the shore of the Arctic ocean.
It was a cold place for a camp, but the men were so delighted
to reach this point that they did not complain of
the temperature.</p>

<p>Franklin here paid a tribute to famous travelers, and
to some of his old friends, by naming the capes and bays
after them. This might be called a cold compliment, but
doubtless the favored ones appreciated it.</p>

<p>The great ocean must have seemed to these men the
end of their journey, yet it was only the beginning. On
July 21 the canoes were launched and one of the most
daring voyages of exploration was begun that has ever
been attempted. Canoes built for use only on lakes and
rivers had now to battle with rough waters filled with ice.
For several weeks Franklin kept on his perilous way eastward,
discovering new islands, bays, and capes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>As freezing weather had already set in, and the provisions
showed signs of giving out, Franklin decided to return to
Fort Enterprise and spend the winter there, hoping to
continue his work along the coast the next summer.</p>

<p>He named the place where he decided to return Point
Turnagain. The distance from the Coppermine to Point
Turnagain is five hundred and fifty miles, and all that
length of coast was traversed and charted by Franklin’s
company.</p>

<p>It was decided to go back to Fort Enterprise by way of
the Hood river, because that route was thought easier
than the other; it proved to be more difficult. Much of
the journey had to be made on foot over a stony country.
The men were loaded down with boats, tents, and blankets,
and, worst of all, the provisions gave out. All that the
adventurers could find to eat was a kind of lichen, which
grew like moss on the rocks. Often the men were wet to
their waists from having to ford streams and tramp through
swamps.</p>

<p>After a time they became so weak and footsore that
they could scarcely walk, and when at last they reached
Fort Enterprise they found it deserted. The Indians who
had promised Franklin to remain and stock the place
with food for him, had abandoned the fort. This was a
terrible blow. Those of the party who were able to walk,
started out to search for the Indians, while the rest remained
in the hut, expecting death every moment. While
these men sat waiting, they saw a herd of reindeer pass
close to the hut. Not a man was strong enough to stand
and shoot, and the deer passed undisturbed. At last some
Indians arrived. They brought plenty of venison with
them, and they stayed with the white men and nursed
them back to health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>When the sick men were able to travel, the party started
again for Hudson bay. They succeeded in reaching
Moose Deer island, and there, under the care of the Hudson
bay officials, Franklin and his followers grew well and
strong.</p>

<p>When they came again to York Factory, Franklin and his
men had traveled 5550 geographical miles and explored
thousands of miles of country never before visited by civilized
men. This journey is one of the most remarkable
in history. Only men of the highest courage and the
strongest determination could have accomplished it.</p>

<p>When Franklin reached England his countrymen bestowed
upon him honors of all sorts. He was promoted

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">IV. FRANKLIN’S SECOND LAND JOURNEY<br />
<small>1825–1827</small></h2>
</div>


<p>After Franklin had been at home about two years, he
began to feel restless and to long for action. About this
time the English government decided to send Parry, for
the third time, in search of the northwest sea passage.</p>

<p>Franklin advised that another land party be sent at the
same time to the mouth of the Mackenzie. There, he
thought, the party should divide, one branch of it to explore
the coast of North America east to the Coppermine
river, the other to go westward to Icy cape. Then the entire
northern coast of North America would have been covered,
and the land party might meet and assist Parry. The government
decided to adopt Franklin’s plan, and when he
begged to be allowed to command this expedition, granted
his request, and more than this, permitted him to make
all arrangements for the expedition. He first ordered
three boats to be built which should be suitable for travel
on both rivers and lakes, as well as on the Arctic ocean.
They must combine light weight with great strength.
In 1824 Franklin sent these boats, filled with stores and
provisions, to Great Bear lake in charge of the Hudson
Bay Company; and on February 16, 1825, he and his
officers sailed.</p>

<p>They traveled through the United States and Canada to
Great Bear lake, where they halted for a few days for
the purpose of bargaining with the Indians for supplies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of food during the winter. Then the party embarked in
canoes and steered for the Mackenzie river.</p>

<p>As the Mackenzie is broad and smooth and without
rapids, they quickly reached Fort Norman, the most northern
Hudson bay post on the river. It was now early in
August, and only a few weeks were left in which to build
winter quarters and to lay in a stock of provisions. A
place on Great Bear lake was chosen for their village, and
Lieutenant Back was given charge of the work of preparation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Franklin pushed on to the mouth of the Mackenzie.
He wished to examine the coast so that he might
know just what was needed for travel along that route when
spring should come. He found it was an easy journey in his
new boat, and when he came to the sea he saw to his joy
that it was free from ice and full of seals and whales.
When he had made himself acquainted with the character
of the coast around the mouth of the river, he returned to
the camp on Great Bear lake.</p>

<p>He found that during his absence his companions had
named the post Fort Franklin in his honor, and very
comfortable arrangements had been made for the winter.
Three houses were ready, one for the officers, one for
the seamen and Indians, and one for supplies. There
were now fifty persons in the party: five officers, nineteen
seamen, nine Canadians, two Eskimos, and the rest Indians,
including men, women, and children. They were a mixed
company, truly, but they passed the season pleasantly together.
The officers worked hard collecting important
facts about the water, ice, animals, mosses, weather,
and sky. They also took charge of a school, which
Franklin insisted upon maintaining for the Indians and
the Eskimos. Attendance at this school was compulsory,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
and you may be sure all the pupils preferred hunting and
fishing. The seamen turned carpenters and built boats.</p>

<p>No one was sorry when spring came and the journey
could be continued. On June 24, 1826, the company
divided into two parties and started down the Mackenzie
river. At the mouth of the river they separated; one
party under command of Franklin proceeded to the west,
the other party under Dr. Richardson, to the east. Each
had provisions enough to last from eighty to one hundred
days.</p>

<p>Franklin and his men soon fell in with an Eskimo tribe
numbering about three hundred. These Eskimos proved
themselves such thieves that it seemed likely that they
might presently murder Franklin and his companions and
take all they had. Lieutenant Back ordered the men in
his boat to point their muskets at the Eskimos; whereupon
they ran away and left the white men in peace.</p>

<p>The journey along the coast was made through blocks
of ice, heavy fogs, and high winds, with a temperature
often below freezing. Yet this was midsummer!</p>

<p>But the party kept bravely on their way, taking observations
of the sun, watching the magnetic needle of the compass,
studying tides, stones, plants, and animals. Among
the greatest hardships that the men suffered were attacks
from swarms of mosquitoes; they dreaded these more than
cold or ice packs.</p>

<p>After three hundred and seventy-four miles of coast had
been explored, Franklin decided that if he continued the
journey, he would not have enough provisions. They had
made half the distance between the mouth of the Mackenzie
river and Icy cape. To the most western point visited,
they gave the name Beechey point. On returning to
Fort Franklin they found that the other party, led by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Dr. Richardson, had also made a successful journey, having
explored eight hundred and sixty-three miles of coast line
between the mouth of the Mackenzie and the mouth of the
Coppermine, and traveled nineteen hundred and eighty<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
geographical miles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Franklin’s own book gives 1989 miles. Greely’s Hand Book gives 1709
miles.</p>

</div>

<p>The success of these two explorations put the company
in good spirits, and the following winter of 1826 was passed
pleasantly at Fort Franklin. Franklin started for home
in February, and reached England September 26, 1827,
after an absence of two years and seven months.</p>

<p>Two months after his arrival he married Jane, daughter
of John Griffin, Esq. This lady, Franklin’s second wife,
was a very remarkable woman, of whom we shall hear
more.</p>

<p>All England was delighted with the results of this
second land journey. Franklin and Richardson together
had surveyed 37° of longitude along the Arctic shore of
North America. The coast from the mouth of the Coppermine
westward to Beechey point had been proved to be
open for navigation, while from Beechey point to Icy cape
it was undoubtedly open.</p>

<p>To complete a northwest passage it was only needful
to find a gap to the eastward, connecting this pathway
for ships with the older discoveries on the Atlantic side.
Over one thousand miles of American coast had been
explored, maps and charts had been made, and knowledge
in all branches of science had been increased.</p>

<p>The honor of knighthood was conferred upon Captain
Franklin, who was afterward to be known as Sir John
Franklin. Parry’s expedition in search of the northwest
passage had been unsuccessful.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">V. THE <i>EREBUS</i> AND THE <i>TERROR</i><br />
<small>1845</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At this time, 1827, England, under the rule of George IV,
was occupied with her own troubles. The disputes between
Catholics and Protestants engaged the attention
of the English people so that interest in exploration waned.
After a short rest at home, Sir John Franklin was sent in
command of her Majesty’s ship, <i>Rainbow</i>, to the Mediterranean
sea. The Greek war of independence was closing,
and Franklin distinguished himself by the judgment and
skill he showed in following out the work intrusted to him.</p>

<p>Upon his return to England, Franklin was offered the
position of Governor of Tasmania, which he accepted, remaining
there seven years. When he returned again to
England in 1842, he found people once more interested in
the discovery of the northwest passage. It was eighteen
years since Franklin had returned from the icy North, but
the northwest passage had not been found. During those
years several expeditions had been at work in the northern
part of North America and along the northern coast, thus
broadening and increasing the geographical knowledge
of the country first entered by Franklin. But the mystery
of the northwest passage still stirred men’s imaginations,
and the Royal Geographical Society decided to send out
another expedition in search of it. The command of this
expedition was offered to Sir John Franklin.</p>

<p>Some people thought that Franklin ought not to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
again to the northern land. These people told him that
he had already done enough for his country, having risked
his life three times, and made more discoveries in that
region than any other man. They reminded him that he
was now sixty years of age, and ought to be willing to
remain at home and let a younger man undertake this
hard and dangerous journey.</p>

<p>But Franklin rejoiced at the thought of seeing the far
North again. He declared that he was only fifty-nine years
of age, and that the discovery of the northwest passage
was the object nearest his heart. Two ships, called the
<i>Erebus</i> and the <i>Terror</i>, were given Franklin for this voyage.
These ships, propelled by steam screws, were the first
vessels of the kind ever used in the Arctic seas. It was
thought that the use of the steam screw instead of the
paddle wheel would prove of great value to navigators in
seas where ice packs and heavy gales were constantly to be
feared. Great results, then, were expected from the expedition
fitted out in this improved manner. Franklin himself
took command of the <i>Erebus</i>, while Captain Crozier was
given command of the <i>Terror</i>. Sufficient provisions were
put aboard the vessels to provide for an absence of three
years, and nothing was left undone that promised to insure
the safety and success of the expedition, or to promote the
health and comfort of the explorers.</p>

<p>The ships sailed from England on May 19, 1845. The
men were in good spirits and hopeful. They sailed north
toward Lancaster sound, and on the 26th of July, 1845, a
whaling vessel, called the <i>Prince of Wales</i>, sighted them in
Melville bay, stuck fast in the ice. The captain of the
whaler received a visit from some of the exploring party,
and was invited to dine with Franklin, but a breeze sprang
up suddenly, and the ships parted company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>That was the last time the <i>Erebus</i> and the <i>Terror</i>, or
any of the men aboard those vessels, were ever seen.
They appeared to have dropped off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>When the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> had been absent two years,
and no news of them had been heard, many expeditions
were sent out to hunt for them. Some traces of the ships
were discovered, and it is believed that the vessels sailed
northward through Lancaster sound to Beechey island,
where they wintered (1845–1846). On this island were
found the graves of two seamen marked with headboards
showing the date of their death.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">In Winter Quarters.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is thought that when spring came, the ships were
released from the ice and proceeded southward toward
King William’s Land. While near to King William’s
Land the vessels were probably again caught in the pack.
The second winter, with its long, dark night, bitter cold,
and absence of proper food, must have been a gloomy one
for these poor men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>If they were still alive when spring came, how they must
have hoped each day for the freeing of the ships! As
the days passed and spring grew to summer, summer to
autumn, yet with no prospect of release from the cruel
pack, the situation became hopeless and intolerable.</p>

<p>All this misery came upon them with greater force
because success was so near. Franklin knew that a distance
of but one hundred miles separated him from the
object of his search. Almost within reach of the goal,
here he was, locked in!</p>

<p>Though the ice did not break up, yet during the spring
(May 24, 1847) Franklin sent a party under the command
of Lieutenant Graham Gore to explore King William’s
Land. This party reached Cape Herschel, a point on the
southern coast of King William’s Land, and in the distance
saw the continent of North America.</p>

<p>A navigable passage was known to exist along the
northern coast of America from Boothia to Bering strait.
Franklin himself and Richardson had discovered and surveyed
the greater part of this extent of country.</p>

<p>Franklin had succeeded in reaching King William’s
Land by entering the Arctic from the Atlantic. Thus the
discovery of the northwest passage was reduced to the
finding of a link which should connect these two known
waterways. This link was found by Graham Gore, when
from Cape Herschel he saw the American coast across a
narrow channel of water. So the credit of the discovery
of the northwest passage must be given to Franklin. Had
it not been for the fact that his ships were beset in the ice,
Franklin would, without doubt, have sailed in 1846 from
the Atlantic to the Pacific along the northern coast of
North America.</p>

<p>As it was, Lieutenant Gore’s discovery connected the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
two known passages and established the fact that an open
waterway existed. Gore wrote a brief record of what his
party had accomplished and left it on the island, where
it was found years later by men who were searching for
Franklin; but neither Franklin nor any of his heroic band
lived to tell in person the news of the discovery.</p>

<p>When Gore returned to the <i>Erebus</i> he found Sir John
very ill. He probably came in time to inform Franklin that
the northwest passage had really been discovered. Let us
hope so. Franklin passed peacefully away June 11, 1847.
He had lived a good life and left a glorious name behind
him.</p>

<p>Captain Crozier of the <i>Terror</i> now took command of the
expedition. The prospect of a third winter in the ice made
the bravest of the men shrink, but it was too late in the
season for them to leave the ships. To do so would have
been certain death. It is best not to try to picture the
misery of the third winter.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1848 there were one hundred and five
men still living. These half-starved creatures decided to
leave the ships and travel by sledges to the North American
coast, where they hoped to meet some Indians who
would give them food and guide them to the Hudson Bay
settlements. Their dreadful march has been traced along
the western coast of King William’s Land, and perhaps a
few of the party reached the southern end of that island.</p>

<p>A number of Eskimos saw and camped with some of
them, but would not remain, fearing that there was not
sufficient food for all. There is no doubt that food gave
out entirely, and that the men died of starvation. Many
years later an old Eskimo woman reported having seen
a party of white men traveling to the south. She said,
“They fell down and died as they walked along.” It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
inspiring to think of the heroism of these brave men who
discovered the northwest passage. Their patience, perseverance,
and devotion to their work deserve our highest
admiration.</p>

<p>In 1847, when, after two years of waiting, no news of
the <i>Erebus</i> or the <i>Terror</i> came to England, great anxiety
was aroused and many searching expeditions were sent
out. Lady Franklin offered a reward of £2000 to any
one who would bring her news of her husband or his companions.
Her courage and her determined efforts to trace
the lost vessels aroused the sympathy of the world. Lady
Franklin spent her entire private means in the search,
and it is largely owing to her efforts that we have any
knowledge at all of her husband’s accomplishment and of
his final fate.</p>

<p>The English government also offered a large reward to
any one who would find the lost ships or crews. In the
autumn of 1850 there were fifteen vessels in the Arctic
ocean, hunting for Franklin and his ships. America joined
England in the search, and as a result the Arctic regions
became far better known than ever before.</p>

<p>Several of these expeditions discovered traces of Franklin.
McClintock found the most important records. He
erected on Beechey island a marble slab which was sent
out by Lady Franklin in memory of her husband and his
brave companions.</p>

<p>If you should go to London, you would find in Waterloo
Place another monument erected to the memory of Franklin.
There is still another at his home in Spilsby. Lady
Franklin also erected a monument to her husband in
Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Although Sir John Franklin deserves the credit of the
discovery of the northwest passage, the first man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
passed through this passage from the Pacific to the Atlantic
was Sir Robert McClure, who made the voyage in
1854. McClure was sent to search for Franklin, and
entered the Arctic ocean through Bering strait. Being
obliged to abandon his ship, he, together with his crew,
crossed the ice of Barrow strait by sledge, where a relief
party met them. This was the first and only expedition
that ever made the northwest passage, which, for purposes
of trade, is useless.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">VI. ELISHA KENT KANE<br />
<small>1853</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One of the most famous efforts to find Sir John Franklin
was made by an American, Mr. Henry Grinnell, of New York
City. From his own private
means he furnished ships
and most of their equipment
for two separate expeditions.
The first Grinnell expedition,
under the command of
Lieutenant De Haven, was
sent out in 1850. It reached
Beechey island on August
27 of the same year, and
assisted in the examination
of Franklin’s winter quarters
there, but returned without
wintering.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Elisha Kent Kane.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The second Grinnell expedition went out three years
later. This was commanded by a man who became almost
as famous as Sir John Franklin himself, Elisha Kent Kane.
Kane had been with De Haven in 1850, and thoroughly
understood the work of Arctic exploration. He liked the
wild, exciting life, and he had an ardent desire to find the
brave men who had been lost, and to bring them home
with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Kane’s plan was to pass up Baffin bay as far north as
it was possible to drive the ship. From that point he
intended to proceed by boats or sledges toward the pole,
examining the coast lines along the way for traces of the
lost party.</p>

<p>The strongly built bark <i>Advance</i> was selected for this
journey, and Kane set sail from New York with seventeen
companions, in May, 1853. After a month the <i>Advance</i>
reached Fiskernaes, a town on the Greenland coast, inhabited
chiefly by Eskimos. To these people a ship was
a very unusual sight, and they swarmed upon the rocks to
gaze at the strange newcomers. The Danish official who
had charge of the colony welcomed Kane and his companions
hospitably.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_033">
  <img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Fiskernaes, Greenland.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Kane had brought all the dried and salted provisions he
could carry, but he knew that his men would need fresh
meat in order to keep well in this climate. Besides, they
had with them about fifty dogs for the sledge journeys
which Kane expected to make when the vessel could no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
longer push her way through the ice. But Eskimo dogs
have large appetites and need plenty of fresh meat to
keep them strong; a good Eskimo hunter was needed to
supply such food.</p>

<p>There was a boy about nineteen years of age in the
town, named Hans Christian, who was known to be very
skillful in the use of the kayak and the javelin. Kane
called upon Hans to try his skill. Hans threw his javelin
and speared a bird on the wing. Kane said, “That is the
man for me,” and wished to engage him on the spot. But
Hans said, “No, not until you promise to give my mother
two barrels of bread and fifty-two pounds of pork.” Kane
agreed, and then Hans went cheerfully on board the
<i>Advance</i>, certain that his mother would not suffer during
his absence.</p>

<p>Kane made one more landing on the Greenland coast,
at Sukkertoppen. The natives of this place collected
reindeer skins, and had just sent four thousand to Denmark.
Kane bought a stock of skins for clothing, also a
large supply of sealskins for boots. The party then bade
farewell to the governor of the colony and put out to sea.</p>

<p>The ship sailed northward for several days. Every day
the weather became colder and the ice thicker. One day
a heavy gale arose, and the ship tossed about so among the
icebergs and the floating cakes that her escape from being
crushed was marvelous. Captain Kane, who was a very
ingenious man, devised a method of avoiding this danger
from ice crushing. His plan was to attach the vessel to
an iceberg and let her float after it, for there is always
open water around a berg. The plan sounded very simple,
but Kane had not reckoned on the nature of icebergs.
After eight hours of hard work the anchors were fastened,
but before the men had time to breathe freely, a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
crackling sounds were heard and pieces of ice the size of
walnuts fell on the deck like hail. The sailors had just
time to cast off from the berg when it fell, with a crash,
into the water around them.</p>

<p>Not long after this the <i>Advance</i> became so firmly fastened
in the ice that they could not push her in any
direction. The party then left the brig and explored the
country around, traveling forty miles, and at last climbing
to the top of an iceberg, a height of eleven hundred feet
above the sea. On every side, as far as the eye could
reach from this great elevation, spread out a solid sea
of ice.</p>

<p>It was now September, and the temperature fell below
freezing. It seemed certain that the <i>Advance</i> could not be
freed from the ice until the next summer, and the explorers
accordingly prepared to pass the winter there.
They succeeded in dragging the vessel and wedging it in
between two islands. In this harbor, known as Rensselaer
bay, the stanch little <i>Advance</i> was frozen solidly in, never
to be released.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">VII. WINTER IN RENSSELAER HARBOR<br />
<small>1853–1854</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The Arctic winter had set in. By the middle of September
the thermometer had fallen to 14° and the ice was
thickening fast. The long Arctic night was upon the
explorers. During that first winter in Rensselaer harbor,
the sun was below the horizon one hundred and twenty
days, and ninety of these days were totally dark; for the
remaining thirty days a faint light like our twilight glimmered
during a part of every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>During the time of darkness little exploring can be
done. Explorers are obliged to stay on or near their ship
and amuse themselves as best they may until the sun
shines again.</p>

<p>Can you fancy a night which lasts as long as ninety of
our days? Think of not seeing the sun for more than
three months! These men on the <i>Advance</i> suffered from
a cold such as we know nothing about, and were often
hungry too. Many of them became ill.</p>

<p>Dr. Kane did everything in his power to buoy up their
spirits. He was wise enough to know that, if his men had
nothing to do, they would become homesick and despairing;
so he planned work for all. Some made clothing and boots
of the furs and skins they had collected; others made
sledges and rope out of hides, or patched up corners of
the brig with moss to prevent the cold from entering.</p>

<p>Dr. Kane himself trained the dogs for the sledge journeys.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
He had ten beautiful Newfoundland dogs which he
harnessed to a low, light sled called the “Little Willie.”
In a short time these gentle, strong, intelligent animals
carried Kane on journeys around the ship with ease. He
drove them two abreast, in teams of four or six, guiding
them entirely by his voice.</p>

<p>With the Eskimo dogs, Kane was obliged to use other
means. Eskimo dogs are not easily managed. They are
near relatives of the wolf, and share the wolf’s nature.
They are driven in teams of ten or twelve, and must be
guided mainly by the whip. Dr. Kane had to use a whip
with a lash six yards long, and a handle only sixteen inches
in length. It required a sort of “sleight of hand” movement
to swing this long lash and hit the right dog with
it. Dr. Kane found this driving very lively exercise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_037">
  <img src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">An Eskimo Dog Team.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Sometimes Kane wanted to travel with a heavier load
than the dogs could draw. For this purpose he used a
larger sledge, thirteen feet long and four feet wide, upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
which he could carry fourteen hundred pounds of baggage.
This sledge was called the “Faith,” and nine men were
often harnessed to it. Each man wore a shoulder belt or,
as it was called, a “rue-raddy.” A walrus-skin trace attached
this rue-raddy to the sledge.</p>

<p>In this way heavy loads of provisions were drawn over
the ice. Kane stored these supplies along the route that
he intended to take as soon as the sun should shine again.
By thus sending provisions ahead and burying them, Kane
hoped to be able to make the journey without fear of starving;
for his whole party could never have carried enough
at once to last during the time he expected to be gone.</p>

<p>On long expeditions where the men were obliged to remain
away from the ship all night, each man carried his
bed with him. An Arctic bed is a bag made of fur, into
which one crawls, covering up all save one’s nose.</p>

<p>On one occasion some of the men delayed in returning
from their trip, and it was feared that they were lost.
After waiting twenty days for them to return, Kane harnessed
four of his best Newfoundland dogs to the “Little
Willie” and started out to search for his missing companions.
He took but one man with him. The ice was full
of cracks and very dangerous. The dogs galloped swiftly
along; whenever they came to a fissure, over it they leaped
and over flew the sledge also, simply by reason of its rapid
movement. At length the party came to a fissure so wide
that the dogs could not leap across it. They were going
too fast to stop or turn aside, and dogs and sledge were
thrown into the water. The two men, who had been running
beside the sledge, quickly cut the harness from the
dogs. The faithful animals, freed from the traces, sprang
to the ice, and with their intelligent help the sledge was
dragged out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>Kane and his companion were wet to the skin with icy
cold water, and the temperature was below zero. What
could prevent men and dogs from freezing? But not a
moment was wasted in thinking about what might happen.
They all started on a run for solid ice, and they ran so fast
that by the time a safe place was reached, they were quite
warm. Several days later they came upon the friends they
were seeking. The return to the ship was made more
easily, although, while leaping a fissure, one unlucky man
was thrown into the water. The rest pulled him out, none
the worse for his cold bath.</p>

<p>The men on the <i>Advance</i> were delighted to see Kane
and their lost comrades again. They rejoiced because
every one was safe. They had also another reason for happiness,
for the dreary night was passing away, the twilight
was growing longer and brighter, and day—a day as long
as the night—was coming. Soon after this Dr. Kane
climbed to the top of a high hill to see the sun. It was
a hard climb, but who would not have taken it for a first
sight of the sun, after a night so long?</p>

<p>Each day the sun came and stayed longer, and with the
sun came warmer weather. At last the sun rose so high
in the heavens that it could not sink below the horizon
at all. Then it shone, not only all day, but also all night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">VIII. THE ESKIMOS<br />
<small>1854</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One morning in the spring, the deck watch ran into Dr.
Kane’s cabin, crying, “People hallooing ashore!” Dr.
Kane hurried to the deck, and through the gloom saw
strange figures all around the harbor. Though it was
April, the sun had not yet risen high in the sky, and
in the twilight these odd figures seemed to be waving
weapons.</p>

<p>Kane soon found that these people were the native
Eskimos, and that they were tossing their arms wildly
about, as if in great excitement. It is no wonder that they
were excited, for they had never seen a white man before;
yet they showed no fear, and one of them came close to
Kane.</p>

<p>This Eskimo was named Metek. He stood a head taller
than Dr. Kane, and was well built and strong, with a dark
skin and black, piercing eyes.</p>

<p>Metek wore booted trousers of white bearskin. At the
toe the boot ended with the claw of the animal. His coat,
or jumper, was of white and blue fox fur, and a hood of
the same fur was on his head. Around his neck was tied
a dirty, greasy strip of deerskin. At first the white men
thought this an ornament, Metek was so careful of it.
Later, Dr. Kane found that it was tied closely around
his neck to keep out the air.</p>

<p>When an Eskimo is fully dressed in his furs, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
deerskin is tied closely around the neck so that no air can
enter, he is, as it were, in a bag of fur. The heat from
his body keeps him warm. As long as he is incased in
air-tight clothing, he is safe from the most severe weather.</p>

<p>All of the Eskimo party were invited to come aboard
the <i>Advance</i>. They were large, strong men, and many
of them could hunt the white bear and the walrus single-handed.</p>

<p>The Eskimos had with them fifty-six fine dogs, tied by
deerskin traces to their sledges, which were made of bone
and lashed together by leather strips. The runners were
of polished ivory, from the tusks of the walrus, and glistened
like steel. The Eskimos’ weapons were knives, which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
carried in their boots, and lances, which were lashed on their
sledges. They had no wood for the handles of these weapons,
because no trees grow in this cold country. All of the
handles were made of bone. You would have thought
these natives very rude indeed, could you have seen how
they behaved on Dr. Kane’s ship. They opened all the
doors and rummaged around in the dark corners. They
opened boxes, handling everything they saw, and putting
all they could inside their jumpers and boots. In fact,
they stole so much that Dr. Kane and his companions had
to follow them continually and take the things out of their
hands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_041">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Eskimos and their Dogs.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>At last the Eskimos became tired, and when the white
men spread a buffalo skin on the floor near the fire, they
threw themselves upon it. For supper each man had a large
piece of raw walrus meat, from which he ate until he was
tired. Then he went to sleep with the raw meat lying
beside him. When he awoke he would seize his meat,
eat more of it, then drop off to sleep again. Many slept
in a sitting position, with their heads falling forward low
on their breasts.</p>

<p>Dr. Kane made a treaty with these people. He bought
all the walrus meat they had, giving them needles, beads,
and old cask staves for it. They promised to bring Kane
more food very soon, and also to lend him their dogs for
his journey to the north. Then Metek said they must
go, and it did not take them long to get ready. They
harnessed the dogs to the sledges quickly, jumped on,
cracked their long sealskin whips, and off they went,
dashing over the ice at a speed of twenty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Some time later Metek again visited Rensselaer Harbor.
This time Dr. Kane decided to go with him to his hut,
and bring back a load of walrus meat. Kane and Metek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
traveled eight miles by sledge, with Metek’s excellent team
of twelve wild Eskimo dogs. They rode very swiftly over
the ice and snow, until at last Kane saw what looked like
two dark spots on the pure white surface. These spots
were the entrances to two Eskimo huts.</p>

<p>The Eskimo huts are built of large stones and are
heavily sodded with turf or moss. They are shaped like
half of an egg, and the entrance is a tunnel, through which
the dwellers creep on their hands and knees. The door is
a slab of slate or ice. At this time the huts were buried
under the snow.</p>

<p>The natives rushed out to meet the travelers. They
seemed delighted to see Kane, but the cold soon drove
them inside again. Kane and Metek followed, crawling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
through a tunnel twelve feet in length, which led them
into the hut of one room about six by fifteen feet. It was
crowded with persons and served for all purposes. The
women were cooking large pieces of walrus meat over
small lamps, and men and children were lying about
half-clothed, calling to one another with uncouth sounds.
Others lay stretched upon the floor sleeping.</p>

    <p class="noic"><small>From a drawing by Dr. Kane.</small></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The thermometer outside registered 30° below zero.
Inside the hut the temperature stood at 90°, nor was
there any place for fresh air to enter. Poor Dr. Kane
was obliged to take off all his fur clothes like the rest.
Being very tired, he soon fell asleep, with an Eskimo boy
for a pillow, and a little Eskimo baby under his arm.</p>

<p>Dr. Kane slept well. When he awoke he was offered
some breakfast of boiled blubber. But, unluckily, he had
seen the women cooking this, and they were so careless
and dirty that he could not touch it. Instead he ate some
pieces of frozen liver which he had brought with him.
After breakfast he started on a walrus hunt.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">IX. HUNTING IN THE ICY NORTH</h2>
</div>


<p>The walrus has been called “the lion of the seas.” He
is a huge animal, often eighteen feet in length. His head
is square, and his cheeks and lips are covered with quills
like bristles. From his face also extend the tusks, which
on the larger animals are often thirty inches in length,
and are prized as ivory. Altogether the walrus is a fierce-looking
creature, with a tough hide and an ugly temper.</p>

<p>Like the seal, the walrus has to come to the surface of
the water to breathe. So Dr. Kane and his Eskimo friends
tried to find open water, or, at least, a place where the ice
was thin. The walrus has a habit of bellowing as he lies
on the ice, so that hunters are guided by this strange and
terrible sound. Every few minutes the hunters took off
their fur hoods to listen.</p>

<p>At last a large walrus rose through the ice, breaking it
with a loud crash. Just as the animal rose out of the
water, Dr. Kane and the Eskimos fell at full length, flat
on the ice. As soon as the head of the walrus sank below
the water again, the hunters jumped up and ran toward
the hole, where they knew it would soon reappear. Every
time the head of the animal was seen coming to the surface,
the hunters would fall to the ice or hide themselves behind
hummocks. In this way—now running, now hiding—they
at last came near enough to the walrus to throw their
harpoon into its body. Tied to the harpoon was a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
rope of walrus hide, which uncoiled rapidly as an Eskimo
ran away to solid ice with one end in his hand. When at
a safe distance, he drove a spike of bone into the ice and
fastened the end of the rope to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_046">
  <img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Walrus Hunt.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, the powerful walrus had been struggling in
the water, breaking up the ice around with a frightful noise.
The Eskimos tightened the rope whenever they could, and
again the walrus rose and threw his powerful body against
the ice, breaking it away; now they had to work fast.
First one, and then another, would seize the spike and run
with it and the rope to a safe place. In this way they
tired the animal out, and were able to give him a second
wound.</p>

<p>During this battle the walrus roared hideously, using
his tusks fiercely. He rushed toward the men and tore
away great pieces of ice with his tusks, but though he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
received many lance wounds, he never once showed fear
or made any attempt to run away.</p>

<p>When the great beast was dead, the Eskimos drew it
up on the ice, the flesh was divided, and Dr. Kane packed
his share upon his sledge. Then with his own four dogs
he set out to return to the brig. He himself ran most
of the way home, because the dogs had difficulty in drawing
the heavy load. The crew were glad to see Kane
once more, and glad, too, for what he had brought.
During the winter fresh meat had been so scarce that
many of the men became sick with the terrible disease
which salt meat produces.</p>

<p>Toward spring Dr. Kane and Hans went hunting for
seals. The seal comes up under the ice where it is
thinnest, and scratches a hole through it with his sharp
claws. Then he hollows out the snow above and makes
an opening just large enough to allow the air to pass
through; this is his breathing hole. It is so small that
often one cannot see it, but the seal makes a blowing noise
in breathing, and the hunters have learned to listen for
this sound.</p>

<p>Kane and Hans often sat many hours on a block of ice
beside a hole, waiting for a seal. When the seal appeared,
one of them quickly thrust a spear into him and usually
killed him. Then Hans would fasten a thong of walrus
hide about the neck of the seal and drag him away, across
the ice, to the ship. The meat of the seal is delicious, and
great was the rejoicing among the men when a hunting
expedition was successful.</p>

<p>When the sun begins to shine, the Eskimos hunt in
a different way. They know that the seals like to
creep out of the water and lie on the ice in the sunshine.
The hunters take with them a sledge with a white screen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
fastened across it, which they push along in front of them,
the screen hiding their bodies from view. A hole in the
middle of the screen gives them a chance to see ahead, and
provides an opening through which they can point a rifle.
When the hunter sees in the distance the bodies of seals
lying on the edge of the ice, he pushes his sledge toward
them. So quietly and so steadily does he move, that
the seals do not become alarmed. They lie still, watching
the strange object, until the hunter is near enough to
shoot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_048">
  <img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Herd of Seals.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the summer comes it is still easier to hunt seals,
for their eyes are blinded by the bright sun shining on the
snow and ice, and the hunters can often walk within gunshot
of them without using the screen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>Kane’s party had plenty of fresh seal meat to eat in the
summer time. From the fat of each animal they obtained
about five gallons of oil, which they used in their lamps.
The fur made warm coats and trousers, while the hides were
used for covering the boats and for whiplashes. Dr. Kane
learned not to waste any part of the seal’s body; even the
bones could be used for hooks and for the handles of tools.</p>

<p>There is another animal in the cold regions which
hunters are eager to slay. This is the large, fierce polar
bear. He has a flat head, a long neck, and smooth, white
fur. He is always found near the sea, where he pursues
seals both in the water and on ice, and preys upon fishes
and birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_049">
  <img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Polar Bears.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Kane had many a chase over the ice after the bears.
When a bear track is seen on the ice or snow, the dogs are
immediately set upon the trail. The hunters follow the
dogs quickly and silently. When they come within sight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of the bear, the hunter releases the dogs from their harness,
so that they may surround the bear and cut off his
retreat. The dogs are carefully trained not to fight the
bear, but to annoy him. They run around him in circles
and prevent him from making his escape. The bear,
when brought to bay, rises on his haunches, seizes the
nearest dog in his teeth and tosses him to one side. The
dogs instinctively relax their muscles in falling, and are
seldom hurt; they usually rise immediately and return to
the conflict. In this way the bear is detained until the
hunters arrive.</p>

<p>Sometimes two hunters engage one animal, striking at
him with their lances. Two men can easily kill a bear.
As one man pretends to thrust his lance into the right side,
the animal turns, and tries to protect himself with his fore
paws. Then the other hunter gives him his death wound
in the left side.</p>

<p>A man must have a great deal of skill and courage
to be able to kill a polar bear single-handed. The single
hunter provokes the bear to follow him by running as if
trying to escape. The bear comes down on all four feet
and prepares to pursue the man. With a rapid jump to
the right, the hunter runs back to his first position. The
bear turns in the same way to follow, when the hunter
skillfully plunges his lance into the left side just below the
shoulder. Even then the most expert hunter sometimes
has to leave his spear in the animal’s side and run for his
life, though a wound given in that spot is usually fatal.
The Eskimos hold in highest esteem the hunter who can
kill a bear single-handed.</p>

<p>The flesh of the bear is used for food, and the fur for
clothing. Dr. Kane killed so many of these animals that
he actually tired of the sport.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">X. HOME AGAIN<br />
<small>1855</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dr. Kane and his companions passed two winters in
the ice regions, living in a place farther north than any
explorers had ever lived in before. Few Arctic explorers
at that time had passed two winter seasons in the ice.</p>

<p>During the cold months the average temperature at
Rensselaer harbor stood at -29°, during the summer
months at 33°. When you consider that the summer was
colder than the average winter in the vicinity of New York
City, you will understand in part what were the severities of
the climate that these men endured. The first winter, with
the long, dark night, was dismal and gloomy, and there
was a great deal of sickness and suffering among the men.
When summer came, Kane hoped that his ship might be
released from the ice. He waited a long time, but the ice
did not thaw, and again winter came upon them suddenly.
It was then too late for the men to escape to the south;
so a second winter was passed on board the <i>Advance</i>. It
was a sad time: many of the men died and many suffered
terribly from disease and want of food.</p>

<p>When the spring of 1855 came, Kane again hoped that
the ice around the brig would thaw and leave her free, for
he was a good commander and could not bear to desert
his ship. At last it became certain that the ice would not
break away, and that the <i>Advance</i> could not be released
that spring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Then Kane decided to leave the ship and try to reach
some settlement on the Greenland coast. The men promised
to follow him and to obey him in all things. They
knew the danger of the journey, but they also knew that
a third winter on the <i>Advance</i> would probably cost them
their lives. At this time the company had provisions
enough to last them thirty-six days. These provisions
were packed in small boats, ready to be dragged over the
ice to open water. All the baggage and the articles
necessary for use in cooking, eating, and sleeping, were
at last ready to be placed on the sledges. Four of the
men were so ill that they also had to be carried.</p>

<p>Each man in the party wore a woolen underdress and
an Eskimo suit of fur. The men’s boots were of their
own make, fashioned of canvas and lined with walrus hide.
Inside of these boots each man wore another pair, made
of carpeting which had been taken from the cabin of the
<i>Advance</i>. To save themselves from becoming snow-blind,
they wore large goggles, made by cutting a small slit in a
piece of wood. Some had entire masks made of gutta
percha.</p>

<p>It was May when Kane and his companions bade farewell
to the brig and set out to cover the thirteen hundred
miles of ice and water which lay between them and the
place where they hoped to find a settlement. Yet they
did not despair. The men who were able to work, dragged
sledges and boats as far as the spot selected for a camp.
Here they built a hut or erected a tent for the sick, making
them as comfortable as they could. Then the workers
went back over the same route and brought along the
baggage, which had been left behind because they could
not carry it all at one time. Thus they were obliged to
travel back over each day’s march, and each following day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
to bring ahead the baggage that could not be carried the
first time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_053">
  <img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Traveling over the Ice Hummocks.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was slow progress, but they kept on bravely. Often
they were delayed by heavy snowstorms. As they could
not drag the sledges through the deep drifts, they crept
into their tents and slept, waiting for the storm to pass
away. When it became possible for them to travel again,
they started out, plowing their way through the snow,
often so tired that they could hardly lift their feet. Sometimes
they journeyed over thin ice, and many a man fell
through and just escaped drowning.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of June when the party reached
the shores of Baffin bay and began to launch the boats.
The launching took a long time, for the surf beat high
along the shore, and great masses of drifting ice were
dashed about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>A severe gale arose, and the boats were nearly crushed
in the ice, but a day later they succeeded in putting off
from the shore. The <i>Faith</i> led the way, with Captain
Kane aboard. Then followed the <i>Red Eric</i>, with most of
the provisions, and last of all, the <i>Hope</i>. These three
small boats were now embarked on a sea in which the
hardiest whaling vessel might easily founder.</p>

<p>The party were all hopeful until provisions were exhausted;
then the stoutest hearts failed. Even Kane despaired
of ever reaching a settlement, but he was too brave
a leader to allow his men to know this, and he encouraged
them in every way possible. The men grew so weak from
want of food that they were scarcely able to guide the boats.</p>

<p>The ice had knocked holes in each of the boats, and
they had to be constantly baled to keep them from sinking.
When everything looked darkest, one of the party
saw a large seal floating on a piece of ice a short distance
away. The half-starved men became so excited that they
could hardly handle the oars. Every preparation was
made to steal quietly toward the animal, which seemed to
be asleep. Stockings were placed over the oars to deaden
the sound, and a man named Peterson, who was thought
to be the best shot of the party, was stationed in the bow
with the rifle.</p>

<p>Silently the oarsmen guided the boat toward the piece
of ice where the seal was lying. When they were almost
within rifle shot, the seal lifted its head and saw the boat.
The men were filled with despair as they saw the animal
move toward the sea as if to plunge in. They all looked
anxiously at Peterson, for their lives depended upon him.
Poor Peterson was trembling with nervousness and weakness.
His hands shook, but with a great effort he steadied
himself and fired. Instantly the seal fell over on its side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>With shouts of delight the men pushed the boat to the
ice, climbed upon it, and seized the animal. They were
half mad with joy, and ran over the ice, crying and laughing,
and waving their knives. Soon every man was eating
raw blubber and licking his bloody fingers with relish. It
was a savage meal, but starved men may be pardoned for
being fierce.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_055">
  <img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Dragging the Boats over the Ice Floes.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Other seals were shot, and soon land was sighted.
Kane directed the course of the boats southward along the
coast, and a few nights later the men landed on the rocks
for rest and sleep.</p>

<p>One morning Peterson, in great excitement, awoke Kane
and told him that he had just seen a native in a kayak,
searching among the rocks along the coast for eider down.
Peterson knew him, and called to him: “Don’t you know
me? I am Carl Peterson.” “No,” the Eskimo answered;
“Peterson’s wife says he is dead.” Then he paddled away
very fast as if in fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>A few days later Kane and his companions were rowing
along in their boats, when the mast of a vessel loomed in
the distance before them. Peterson burst into sobs in his
excitement, and in broken English and Danish exclaimed,
“It’s the Upernavik oil boat!” Indeed, it was the vessel
that goes once a year to Upernavik for a supply of blubber
to make oil. Soon the vessel came near enough for
the crews to talk to each other. You may be sure that
Captain Kane’s party wanted to know what had happened
during their long absence from home. The first question
Kane asked was whether Franklin had been found.</p>

<p>The sailors told him that some traces of Franklin had
been seen, but that it was now supposed that he and all of
his companions had perished. This news made Kane very
sad, for no one knew better than he what suffering Franklin
and his men must have endured.</p>

<p>After learning all that these men could tell him, Kane
journeyed on. After another halt for sleep, and another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
long pull at the oars, the men heard the welcome sound of
barking dogs at the settlement.</p>

<p>The people of Upernavik were very kind to Kane and
his men. They fitted up a loft for them to sleep in and
shared their stores in a liberal manner.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Upernavik, Greenland.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A Danish vessel, starting for home early in September,
took Kane and his party on board, promising to land them
at the Shetland islands. On the 11th the vessel reached
Disco, where another steamer was sighted in the distance.
As she drew near Kane’s men saw with joy that she carried
the American flag. The vessel proved to be a relief ship
sent out by the United States to search for Captain Kane.
The men, under command of Lieutenant Hartstene, greeted
Kane and his companions with cheers and took them aboard.
The <i>Faith</i>, which had done such excellent service, was
taken on board also, and may now be seen at the Brooklyn
navy yard. Though Kane had been compelled to leave the
<i>Advance</i> in the ice, had lost his equipment, and had found
no trace of Sir John Franklin, yet his expedition was by
no means a failure. The geographical and scientific value
of the knowledge which he gained during his stay in the
icy North was very great.</p>

<p>Large tracts of country, before unknown, had been discovered
and surveyed; the coast of Greenland had been
explored as far north as latitude 81°, and the great glacier
of Humboldt, with a sea face forty-five miles in length,
discovered. New land to the north of Humboldt glacier
was also discovered and named Washington Land.</p>

<p>A great channel to the northwest, free from ice, was
supposed to lead into an open polar sea. The theory of
an open polar sea, however, has not yet been proved.</p>

<p>Grinnell Land was discovered, and a survey made of the
lands bordering on Smith sound. Valuable facts in relation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
to the tides, climates, and plants were compiled, and
a study was made of the Eskimos of Smith sound. Kane
received gold medals from the Queen of England, the
Royal Geographical Society of London, the American
Congress, and the New York Legislature.</p>

<p>But Kane’s health, never of the best, now began to fail.
He went to England, but while there grew rapidly worse.
He then sailed for Havana, hoping that the balmy climate
would benefit him; but it was too late for him to recover
his health, and he died at Havana, February 16, 1857.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">XI. NORDENSKJÖLD AND THE NORTHEAST
PASSAGE<br />
<small>1878–1879</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next man to journey into the frozen North was
Adolf Erik Nordenskjöld.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was born in Finland and
educated at its university; but when he was about twenty-two
years of age he fell under the suspicion of the Russian
government and was compelled to leave his native country.
Nordenskjöld then took up his residence in Sweden, and in
1858 began his career as an Arctic explorer by going on a
journey to Spitzbergen. Five voyages in the Arctic regions
followed, during one of which Nordenskjöld visited Greenland
and made an inland journey over the ice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Pronounced <i>Norʹ den sheld</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The interior of Greenland is believed to be one vast
glacier, moving slowly to the sea. This movement causes
the formation of deep chasms and clefts which are almost
bottomless, and which prevent the traveler from making
rapid progress.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the dangers and hardships of the journey,
Nordenskjöld advanced thirty miles over the glacier
to a height of twenty-two hundred feet above the level of
the sea. Upon returning to the coast, he visited Disco
Fiord, and then went home to Sweden.</p>

<p>About the time that Nordenskjöld reached home, the
Swedish government decided to send a sledge expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
from Spitzbergen to the North Pole. The nation which
should first succeed in reaching the pole would gain the
admiration of the civilized world, and Sweden hoped to
win this glory.</p>

<p>The government began at once to look for a leader for
this expedition, and very naturally selected Nordenskjöld,
who had already made Arctic voyages and had thereby
gained experience which made him a valuable commander.</p>

<p>The party was sent out in 1872, but did not succeed in
advancing far toward the pole; yet the results of the
journey were important, for the island of Spitzbergen was
explored and a good deal of scientific information was acquired.</p>

<p>When Professor Nordenskjöld returned from Spitzbergen,
he gave his attention to the northern coast of Asia.
Some few whalers had sailed round Nova Zembla and
entered the Kara sea, but the idea prevailed that this sea
was always full of ice and dangerous to navigate. Nordenskjöld,
however, made up his mind to explore the Kara
sea and sail along the coast of Siberia to the mouth of the
Yenisei river.</p>

<p>Supported by Mr. Oscar Dickson of Gothenburg, Nordenskjöld
sailed on the <i>Proven</i>. He first visited Nova
Zembla, and then, passing through Jugor strait, entered the
Kara sea, which was entirely free from ice, and reached
the Yenisei river without much difficulty. During this
journey, he and his assistants made valuable collections of
the products of the animal, mineral, and vegetable kingdoms.
They succeeded in increasing the number of known
insects to be found in Nova Zembla from seven to one
hundred, and in the Kara sea, which had been thought barren,
they found five hundred species of animal life. Upon
reaching the mouth of the Yenisei river, Nordenskjöld<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
sent the <i>Proven</i> home, while he and a few chosen companions
proceeded up the river in a small boat.</p>

<p>It was summer time and the tundras were covered with
a scanty vegetation. The tundras are the plains of Russia
and Siberia which lie between the tree limit and the Arctic
ocean. Most persons think of them as entirely barren;
in some parts the soil is fertile and would be suitable for
cultivation, if the climate permitted. In the winter they
are frozen, but in the summer they afford pasture to herds
of reindeer.</p>

<p>All Siberia is colder than other places in the same latitude.
One of the best-known cold regions on the earth
is in Siberia, in latitude 67° 54ʹ N. Here the average temperature
of the winter months is often as low as -53°, while
some days the thermometer falls to -75° and -85° F.</p>

<p>The tundras are inhabited by a tribe of Siberian Indians
called Samoyeds. These natives travel about during the
summer, hunting and fishing, setting up their skin tents
wherever they find game plentiful. They usually have
with them a large number of dogs, which they use for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
sledging in winter and drawing boats against the current
during the summer. The dogs run alongshore and drag
the boats after them up the river, very much as mules draw
our canal boats. The Samoyeds are small of stature and
very dirty. Their hair is matted and unkempt, and they
wear clothes of skin, with sometimes a bright-colored cotton
shirt over the skin blouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_061">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Samoyed Huts in Summer.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>These people worship idols, which look like dolls made
of skin, and which they always carry with them on their
travels. Some of these idols, or gods, have faces of brass
or copper, and some carry bows made of forged iron. The
Samoyeds worship by making
pilgrimages to certain
spots, where they offer sacrifices
and make vows; they
eat the flesh of their victims,
and besmear their idols with
the blood. At these sacred
places there are piles of
bones and skulls of the reindeer,
with the horns. Near
by are also found quantities
of old iron, and hundreds of
small wooden sticks, carved
to look like human faces.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_062">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Samoyed Family in Winter Costume.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was to this Samoyed
country that the Russian government used to send her
criminals, and there are many exiles living there now; but
the natives treat them very kindly and never inquire into
the cause of their banishment.</p>

<p>As Nordenskjöld and his companions traveled on, they
saw large masses of driftwood lying along the shores of
the river. This driftwood is carried by the current out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
into the Arctic ocean, and is often picked up by explorers
on the North American and Greenland shores, a fact which
seems to prove that the ocean currents carry it across the
polar sea. At length the travelers entered the region
from which this driftwood comes. This is the great forest
belt of Siberia, the largest in the world, extending, with
but little interruption, from the Ural mountains to the
Sea of Okhotsk. It consists mainly of enormous pines,
growing thickly, and untouched by the ax of the lumberman.
Many trees are withered with age; others are fallen,
and their decayed trunks are covered with mosses and
lichens. The wilderness is so vast that a man might
wander hundreds of miles without meeting a human being.</p>

<p>Beyond the forest belt lie the fertile plains, which are
partly cultivated and which supply Europe with wheat.
Nordenskjöld visited these plains, or steppes, and then
proceeded homeward overland, by way of St. Petersburg.
The next year, 1876, Nordenskjöld made a second voyage
from Sweden to the mouth of the Yenisei river, proving
beyond a doubt that there is a sea route from the Atlantic
to the mouth of the great Siberian river. For this achievement
he was regarded by Russia as a national benefactor
and publicly thanked.</p>

<p>Nordenskjöld hoped that the rich produce of central
Asia, the gold, silver, copper, iron, and coal, the ivory,
timber, wheat, and furs, might now be shipped through the
rivers to the Arctic ocean and thence to Europe. The
dangers of navigation through the ice, however, are so
great that it is doubtful whether this route can ever
become an important one for purposes of commerce.</p>

<p>Nordenskjöld was not yet satisfied with the work he had
accomplished in the Arctic regions. He longed to do
what Arctic explorers had been trying to do for three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
years; namely, to find a northeast passage to the
Pacific. Supported by King Oscar of Sweden and by Mr.
Oscar Dickson of Gothenburg, Nordenskjöld sailed from
Tromsö in his ship, the <i>Vega</i>, July 21, 1878, accompanied
by three other vessels. Two of the vessels left him at the
mouth of the Yenisei and proceeded up that river, while
the other, the <i>Lena</i>, accompanied the <i>Vega</i> eastward. The
fog caused the sailors more trouble than the ice, but one
day the mist rose, showing a dark ice-free cape. Then
Nordenskjöld knew that he had succeeded in reaching the
northernmost point of the Old World, Cape Tcheliuskin
(Chelyuskin).</p>

<p>More than a century earlier, Lieutenant Tcheliuskin, a
Russian officer, had succeeded in reaching this most northern
point of Siberia, traveling overland by sledge. Many
explorers had tried to reach Cape Tcheliuskin by water, but
up to this time all had failed. Nordenskjöld and his companions
were very proud of their success. Flags were
hoisted, salutes fired, and the officers drank toasts in honor
of the occasion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_065">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The “Vega” firing a Salute at Cape Tcheliuskin, the Most
Northern Point of the Old World.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A heap of stones, called a cairn, was erected on shore
as a memorial, and soon the two vessels started again on
their journey eastward. When the mouth of the Lena
river was reached, the ship <i>Lena</i> headed toward it and,
after exploring the river, returned home.</p>

<p>After parting from the <i>Lena</i>, the <i>Vega</i> continued her
voyage to the New Siberian islands and thence along the
coast of Asia, nearly to Bering strait. When within a
day’s journey of the strait, the <i>Vega</i> was beset in the ice;
and, much to Nordenskjöld’s regret, he was obliged to pass
the winter at the very entrance to the Pacific ocean. Had
he been a few hours earlier, he might have forced his
way through the ice and completed the northeast passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
in 1878. But in that case we should never have known all
the interesting facts which he has told us about the strange
people who inhabit the northeastern peninsula of Asia.</p>

<p>These people are a Siberian tribe, called Tchuktches.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
There are two divisions of the tribe, the reindeer Tchuktches
and the coast Tchuktches. The former own herds
of reindeer, and travel about, pitching their tents wherever
the pasture is good. They also trade in skins, hides, furs,
and whalebones with the most northern Indian tribes of
America and with the Russian fur dealers, often making
long journeys for this purpose. The coast Tchuktches live
along the shore, and hunt and fish for their living.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> Pronounced <i>Chookʹ chez</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The reindeer Tchuktches were encamped near the <i>Vega’s</i>
winter quarters. As soon as these people saw a strange
ship anchored off the coast, they launched a large skin
boat very skillfully, and men, women, and children jumped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in and rowed through the thin, newly formed ice to the
vessel. They climbed aboard and seemed as pleased to
see the white men as if they had been old friends. The
deck of the <i>Vega</i> became a reception room, for not a day
passed without a visit from the natives.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_066">
  <img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Tchuktche and Reindeer</span>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Tchuktches are a strong, hardy race, but very lazy.
Nothing but want of food induces them to work. Many
are tall, with brown skin and raven-black hair, and a large
nose like that of our North American Indians. Some have
high cheek bones and slanting eyes, like the Mongolian
race. They live in tents, which are made double to insure
warmth during the winter. The inner tent is the sleeping
room. The framework is of wood, and over this are spread
thick reindeer skins. The floor is a walrus skin, and at
night extra reindeer skins are thrown down like a carpet.
The inner tent is heated by three train-oil lamps, which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
together with the heat from the bodies of the many human
beings who are packed in this small space, raise the temperature
in the tent to such a degree that even in the most
severe weather, the natives strip off all their clothing. In
the winter they live, cook, and work in the inner tent; the
outer tent, used in summer, is built around the inner tent.
The skins of the outer tent are older and thinner than
those of the inner one.</p>

<p>The Tchuktche women work very hard. They take
care of the children, cook, sew, and keep the tent in order.
They receive the game and cut it up, in winter in the tent
and in summer on the beach. They help with the fishing;
they tan the hides and prepare thread from the sinews.
The men provide the food, which they obtain by fishing,
hunting, and trading. But in and around the tent they do
nothing but put their hunting tools in order, or play with
the children.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_068">
  <img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Tchuktche Man and Woman.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Tchuktche children are healthy and hearty. They often
cross from one tent to another entirely naked, when the
weather is bitterly cold. The children are petted and
treated very kindly. The older people never utter an
angry word to them, or punish them. For playthings they
have dolls, bows, and windmills with sails. Tchuktche
children are very well-behaved. A little girl fell down the
ship’s stairs head first, and received so severe a blow that
her hearing was nearly destroyed, yet she scarcely uttered
a cry. A small boy of four years once visited the ship.
He was so wrapped up in furs that he looked like a ball
and could hardly move. He fell into a ditch which had
been cut in the ice on the deck, and could not get out.
The small Tchuktche did not make a sound, but waited
patiently until some one saw him lying there and rescued
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>When the ice became solid, the natives came on their
dog sleds from villages far away. Sometimes they brought
skins and whalebones to exchange for tobacco and brandy,
but they obtained very little of the latter from the men on
the <i>Vega</i>. As winter advanced, the natives’ provisions
gave out. Then they gathered around the ship at the time
when they knew the crew were at dinner, and begged for
food so hard that one day the cook himself came out with
a large kettle full of meat soup. The Tchuktches seized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
it like starving animals and bailed it out with spoons, empty
tin cans, and even with their hands. Nordenskjöld gave
them all the food he could spare, but in spite of his kindness
the plump little babies grew thin and hollow-eyed.
One day the Tchuktche hunters killed a polar bear and
several seals. Then begging ceased for a few days, and
they rested from hunting and lived on the fat of the land,
without any thought of the future.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_069">
  <img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Hunting Reindeer.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A few days later a procession of Tchuktches was again
seen, coming in single file over the ice toward the ship,
each man carrying a piece of ice on his shoulder. This
he gave to the cook, begging for something to eat in return;
and you may be sure that all the food that could be
spared was given to these poor people.</p>

<p>One morning a number of men approached the ship,
dragging a dog sledge on which a man lay so quietly that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
Nordenskjöld thought he must be ill or dead. To his surprise,
when the sledge reached the side of the vessel, the
man climbed rapidly to the deck and saluted. He then
informed Nordenskjöld in broken Russian that he was the
great chief of the Tchuktches, and, as a mark of his high
rank, he had been drawn over the ice by men instead of
dogs.</p>

<p>This man’s name was Menka. He gave Nordenskjöld
two roasts of reindeer meat, and in return received some
tobacco and a woolen shirt. Finding that Menka was
going to a Russian town some distance away, Nordenskjöld
asked him to carry a letter to the Russian authorities
there, as he wanted to let King Oscar know where he was.
Menka consented, and Nordenskjöld wrote the letter and
gave it to him. Whether Menka misunderstood or not,
no one knows; but when he reached shore he assembled
the Tchuktches, opened the letter, and, holding it upside
down, gravely read it in his own language to his admiring
audience. His hearers thought him very learned indeed.</p>

<p>The next day the great chief again visited the <i>Vega</i>,
but no one mentioned the letter for fear of hurting his
feelings. Menka doubtless meant no harm. The Tchuktches
seem to have been very democratic in their sentiments;
they refused to admit that Menka was their chief,
saying that they were just as good as he was.</p>

<p>When Christmas came, some of the whites persuaded
the Tchuktches to bring them a load of willows from the
valleys in the south. They took a piece of wood for the
stem and, tying on the willow bushes for branches, called
it a Christmas tree, and decorated it with flags, colored
papers, and wax lights. A box of Christmas presents had
been placed on board by their friends at home; this was
opened and the presents distributed. Then the men danced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
a polka around the tree and drank the good health of all
their friends.</p>

<p>The spring came slowly, and time dragged, though the
men were very busy collecting specimens and noting the
curious changes in the atmosphere and vegetation. It
seemed as if the ice would never break up. On July 18,
1879, Nordenskjöld and his companions sat down to dinner
as usual. During the meal the vessel, which had been
motionless for months, moved slightly. It was a moment
of intense excitement, and everybody rushed on deck.
The ice was moving! It did not take long for the engineer
to light the boiler fires, and in two hours the <i>Vega</i> was
free and on her way to Bering strait. There was not much
time to say farewell to the Tchuktches, who gathered
on the shore and watched the departure of their white
friends.</p>

<p>The <i>Vega</i> encountered but little ice, and at 11 o’clock
on the morning of July 20, 1879, she sailed into the middle
of the strait that connects the Arctic and Pacific oceans.
Salutes were fired and flags raised. The northeastern passage
was accomplished. In a single voyage Nordenskjöld
had succeeded in doing what Arctic explorers had been
trying to achieve for three hundred years.</p>

<p>On his way home Nordenskjöld visited Japan. He
remained there two weeks, collecting facts which contributed
a great deal to our knowledge of that country.
When Nordenskjöld reached home, King Oscar made him
a baron, and commander of the Order of the North Star.
The remainder of his life was spent in scientific work. In
August, 1901, this great man passed away, leaving behind
him a lasting fame.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">XII. VOYAGE OF THE <i>JEANNETTE</i><br />
<small>1879–1881</small></h2>
</div>


<p>During the same month, July, 1879, that Nordenskjöld
completed the northeast passage by sailing through Bering
strait into the Pacific ocean, an expedition sailed from
San Francisco northward through Bering sea on a voyage
of discovery in Arctic regions.</p>

<p>This expedition was sent out by Mr. James Gordon Bennett,
the owner of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>. Mr. Bennett
bought and equipped a vessel, which he called the <i>Jeannette</i>.
By special act of Congress, the <i>Jeannette</i> was conducted
by the United States Navy, with the rights and
privileges of a government vessel.</p>

<p>The command was offered to Lieutenant George W. De
Long and he accepted, after the expedition was made
national. De Long, it is said, believed that an expedition
might reach the North Pole by following a branch of the
Japan Current through Bering strait and into the Arctic
ocean, a route which had never been attempted.</p>

<p>Many explorers who had made trips to the Arctic
regions observed that the ice always drifted toward the
southeast, and entered the Atlantic ocean between the
islands of Spitzbergen and Greenland. It was thought
that there must be a strong southeast current to carry
this pack of floating ice always in the same direction.
Instead of trying to sail northward between Spitzbergen
and Greenland, where they must meet that great ice pack,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
these men said: “Let us enter the Arctic ocean through
Bering strait and sail northward toward the pole. If the
ship is caught in the ice pack, she will drift along with
the pack into the Atlantic ocean. Perhaps the drift will
carry the ship across the North Pole.”</p>

<p>De Long sailed from San Francisco on the <i>Jeannette</i>,
July 8, 1879. It was a beautiful sunny day, and many
vessels were gathered in San Francisco bay to attend
the departure. Guns were fired, flags waved, and cheers
given with a will for the brave men who were going to
risk their lives in the search for the North Pole.</p>

<p>The <i>Jeannette</i> sailed away through the Pacific ocean.
She crossed Bering sea in a heavy gale, and passed
through Bering strait in safety. After rounding East
cape, the watch in the crow’s nest saw some rude huts
along the beach. They were the homes of the Tchuktches,
the Siberian race which inhabits this peninsula.</p>

<p>The ice alongshore prevented De Long from landing,
and the natives, seeing this, launched a large skin boat
and went out to the ship. The Indian chief went with
them, and they all boarded the <i>Jeannette</i>. These people
could furnish very little information, because no one on
board knew their language and they could speak no English.
But De Long learned, by means of signs and motions,
that Nordenskjöld, with the <i>Vega</i>, had wintered to the
northwest of them, and that a few weeks before he had
passed out through Bering strait.</p>

<p>The Tchuktches had a delightfully original way of asking
for liquor. They bent their elbows and uttered the
word “Schnapps.” But they did not get anything to
drink, and soon returned to the shore.</p>

<p>The next day some men from the <i>Jeannette</i> succeeded
in landing. They found the Tchuktches living in tents<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
made of skin, and very dirty. They ate the raw flesh of
the walrus and drank the blood. Their chief wore a red
calico gown as a mark of his high rank. It was a cool
garment for so cold a place, but the natives do not feel
the cold as keenly as we should.</p>

<p>After sailing along the Siberian coast for a short distance,
the <i>Jeannette</i> bade farewell to land and started on
her perilous journey.</p>

<p>In the Arctic regions the ice is divided into what is
known as young ice and the pack. Young ice is that
which is forming all the time. It is thin at first, and
vessels can usually cut their way through. The pack is
the old ice which has been formed for many years, and is
composed of large pieces, called floes, which are often
thirty or forty feet thick and extend over a great surface
both above and below the water.</p>

<p>The floes sometimes close up and float together as a
pack, squeezing in everything between them. Sometimes
they separate, leaving channels of water between. The
pack floats with the wind and the current, and there is little
chance of escape from it. If a ship is caught in the ice
pack, it must float with it until a storm or some other
change of weather breaks up the pack. When a ship
is strong enough to resist the pressure of the ice pack,
there is some chance of escape in the spring, but so tremendous
is the power of the ice that Arctic voyagers
avoid the pack if possible.</p>

<p>It seems to have been De Long’s intention deliberately
to enter the pack and drift with it, for when, on September
6, he saw an opening between the Siberian and the
American packs, he slipped in. At first the <i>Jeannette</i>
pushed her way bravely, but after a few hours she was
unable to proceed, and soon she was frozen in solidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The “Jeannette” in the Ice Pack.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To the southwest lay Herald island, which the men
attempted to explore. Taking a dog sledge, they traveled
to within six miles of the beach, where they found open
water, so that they were obliged to return to the ship without
setting foot on land. They found the ship drifting
with the ice, and in danger of being crushed between the
huge masses which surrounded her. Thundering noises
from far away could be heard as the blocks of ice ground
and grated together. At times the ice separated near the
ship, leaving it in clear water. Again, the pack closed up
about the stanch little vessel, which was like an eggshell
at the mercy of enormous blocks of floating ice.</p>

<p>But all this time the <i>Jeannette</i> was drifting, and at length
she came in sight of Wrangel Land. Before De Long
lost sight of this land, he satisfied himself that it was an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
island, and not a part of Greenland as some explorers had
supposed.</p>

<p>On November 10 the black Arctic night began, which
lasted until January 25. The bitterness of the cold during
this long period of darkness is inconceivable. The
surface water was usually at a temperature of 29° F., the
freezing point of salt water.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their discomforts, the men followed a
regular routine. At seven o’clock in the morning all on
board were called and the fires were started in the galleys.
At nine o’clock the explorers ate their breakfast. From
eleven until one o’clock every man took his gun and went
out on the ice to exercise. At three in the afternoon dinner
was served, and the galley fires were put out in order to
save coal. Between seven and eight o’clock tea was made.
The crew lived on pork and beans, salt beef, and canned
goods. Sometimes, when the hunters were successful, they
had the meat of the seal, bear, or walrus. For amusements
there were theatricals and a navigation class.</p>

<p>For one year and nine months the <i>Jeannette</i> floated in
the pack, at the mercy of wind and tide. The coldest
weather came in February, when the thermometer registered
58° below zero. In spite of the windings and turnings
of their course, the general direction was toward the
northwest. De Long trusted to the strength of his ship to
withstand the pressure of the ice, and float across the pole
out into the Atlantic ocean. At length, on May 17, 1881,
land was sighted. It proved to be an island not indicated
on the chart of that region. De Long therefore claimed it
as a discovery, and named it Jeannette island. Another
island was discovered not far away, and called Henrietta.</p>

<p>A sledge party under Melville was sent out from the
ship to explore this island. The ice over which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
traveled consisted of large blocks that floated rapidly and
were constantly changing their position. Sometimes the
men were obliged to jump into the water and swim from
one block to another. The dogs were almost useless; they
refused to jump, and tried to run away. The men pushed
them into the water, and then they had to swim for their
lives. This seems cruel treatment, but Arctic exploration
means severe suffering for all who engage in it, and the
help of the dogs was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Henrietta island was rocky and ice-capped, not in itself
a very valuable possession for the United States of America;
yet the Stars and Stripes were set up there, and a square
copper case, containing copies of the <cite>New York Herald</cite>
and a record of the voyage, was placed in a cairn. Then
the sledge party returned to the ship. The <i>Jeannette</i> was
in dire distress, for the ice around her, now rapidly breaking
up, was by turns receding and closing in. Every time
it closed in, it pressed against her sides with tremendous
force, so that her timbers fairly creaked.</p>

<p>But brave Captain De Long would not leave his ship
until he was quite certain that she was going to sink, and
her hold was full of water before he gave orders to abandon
her. Then the crew had to work with desperate haste
to transfer provisions, tents, and boats to a safe place on
the ice. At four o’clock in the morning of June 13, the
<i>Jeannette</i> sank to the bottom of the Arctic ocean. The
ice closed over the place where the little vessel had endured
such terrific grinding for twenty-one months, and
only a cabin chair and a few pieces of wood remained to
mark the spot.</p>

<p>Imagine the condition of the men left on the ice so many
miles from land. But they worked with calm courage to
arrange their provisions and all the articles which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
needful for camping on the sledges, and four days after
the <i>Jeannette</i> had sunk, the retreat across the ice began.</p>

<p>This march was one of the most difficult ever undertaken.
In one day the travelers could cover a distance of
only a mile, or at most a mile and a half. Thirteen times
they were compelled to go over the road, seven times with
loads, six times without, traveling a distance of twenty-six
miles in order to cover an advance of two miles. Many
of the party were taken ill and had to be carried by their
companions.</p>

<p>At the end of the week, De Long found that the ice
over which they were traveling had floated northwest
faster than they had traveled south; consequently the
party was twenty-seven miles farther away from the
Siberian coast than when they started. De Long kept
this disheartening fact a secret from his men, lest they
should despair.</p>

<p>On and on they traveled, day after day, until at last a
dim line of land came into view; it proved to be a new
island, with rocky shores and steep sides. It was a difficult
task to cross the channel of water which separated
the ice pack from this bleak coast, but Captain De Long
ordered all his men to attempt the crossing. They raised
the American flag and took possession of the island in the
name of the President of the United States. This land De
Long called Bennett island. Thousands of birds were
found among the rocks, and the men had a refreshing
feast after their weeks of weary work. The sides of Bennett
island were bold and steep, and landslides occurred
several times.</p>

<p>It was thought best to continue the journey by water.
There were three boats, and a part of the supplies was
placed in each boat. De Long commanded one, Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Chipps another, and Engineer Melville the third. When
the New Siberian islands came in sight, the voyagers knew
that they were nearing the mouth of the Lena river. This
large stream flows across Siberia into the Arctic ocean.
Its banks are usually occupied by tribes of Indians, who
remain there during the summer season to fish and hunt.
It was encouraging to know that land was so near, and
the weary travelers kept bravely on, working with all their
strength to steer through the masses of ice. It seemed as
if two new perils sprang up for every danger escaped. In
a heavy gale Lieutenant Chipps’s boat went down, and De
Long and Melville lost sight of each other. Melville at
length succeeded in guiding his boat to the mouth of the
Lena river.</p>

<p>The country appeared to be deserted, and it seemed
probable that they had escaped from drowning, only to
perish from cold and starvation. But after they had traveled
some distance up the river, and were just about to
give up in despair, they met some natives.</p>

<p>Melville ordered the natives to spread the report of the
two missing boats wherever they went. Two of them were
sent with dog teams as a searching party to the different
towns on the delta. After thirteen days they returned
with tidings of the missing crews. They had met two men
of Captain De Long’s party, Noros and Nindemann, who
had succeeded in making their way to a deserted fishing
station; but they were in a pitiable condition. Although
a severe storm was raging, Melville started immediately
for this place with his dog team, carrying food with him.</p>

<p>He found Noros and Nindemann in a small hut, nearly
dead from cold and hunger. After making them comfortable,
and learning from them where they had left De
Long, Melville pushed on. Storms delayed him in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
search, so that when he reached the part of the river where
De Long’s party was last seen, he abandoned all hope of
finding any of them alive, for they had been without provisions
two days when Nindemann left them, and that part
of the country was entirely destitute of food.</p>

<p>Yet Melville continued his search, determined to find the
missing men, alive or dead. After heroic, untiring efforts,
he found the dead bodies of his shipmates. They had
perished five months before.</p>

<p>After attending to the burial of his brave comrades, and
rewarding the natives who had assisted him, Melville set
out for home. He arrived in New York, September 13,
1883, just one year from the day on which the three boats
were separated in the gale. Due credit has been given
Engineer Melville, both at home and abroad, for his
promptness and energy in conducting the search for the
lost crew of the <i>Jeannette</i>.</p>

<p>The fate of the <i>Jeannette</i> and her crew often leads
people to overlook the results secured by her voyage. The
long drift of twenty-one months enabled the voyagers of
this expedition to acquire considerable knowledge of the
ocean. The ship traveled over a large area, sometimes
moving almost in a circle. The depth of the ocean, the
character of its bed and its drift were determined. Many
kinds of animal life were studied, and two islands were discovered.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">XIII. GREELY IN GRINNELL LAND<br />
<small>1881–1883</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Interest in the Frozen North became so great, that a
conference of nations was held in Hamburg, Germany, in
1879, to discuss plans by means of which knowledge of
that part of the world might be advanced. Eleven countries
were represented, and it was decided to send out
expeditions and establish stations for the purpose of making
scientific observations. Fifteen expeditions were sent
out by different countries, and fourteen stations were
established. These stations were known as the International
Circumpolar stations, and their work was to be
coöperative.</p>

<p>The United States decided to establish two stations, one
at Point Barrow, Alaska, and the other in Lady Franklin
bay. The command of the expedition to Point Barrow
was given to Lieutenant Ray. Adolphus Washington
Greely, a lieutenant in the United States Army, was
offered command of the other, and when the enterprise
was made national in 1881, he accepted the commission.</p>

<p>The arrangements necessary for the journey were soon
made, and Greely and his companions sailed on the
<i>Proteus</i> to Newfoundland. They left that island on
July 7, 1881, and headed for the north. The <i>Proteus</i>
sailed through Davis strait and Baffin bay, passing the
wonderful “bird cliffs,” which rise perpendicularly for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
over a thousand feet out of the sea, and are broken only
by narrow ledges. Neither Eskimo nor animal can reach
these rocks, and here, safe from harm, the birds lay their
eggs and hatch out their young by the tens of thousands.
Greely’s men shot many birds and secured hundreds of
eggs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_082">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Bird Cliffs.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Proteus</i> passed through Smith sound and Kennedy
channel, and reached Lady Franklin bay in safety. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
anchored at last in Discovery bay, on the coast of Grinnell
land, where Greely and his men went ashore to select a
place suitable for a camp, to be named Fort Conger. Then
the <i>Proteus</i> steamed away, leaving a small company of
men alone in the Arctic solitude. But they were too busy
to feel lonely, and began to work hard in order to make a
comfortable home for themselves. The house was built of
wood covered with tarred paper, and stations for the instruments
were erected near at hand.</p>

<p>The cliffs around Discovery harbor rise from a hundred
to a thousand feet in height and nearly surround the bay,
which contains about twenty square miles of ice floe.
Game was plentiful. Large flocks of eider ducks visited
an open pool near by, and herds of musk oxen were to be
seen in the distance, grazing quietly. The Arctic summer
was at its height, and the slopes were covered with grasses,
mosses, and buttercups.</p>

<p>Under the direction of Lieutenant Greely, the men took
observations, explored the country, and built depots. The
depots were built at convenient distances from Fort Conger,
and were stored with supplies of food for the use of exploring
parties. At last so much had been accomplished that
Greely thought he might safely leave the camp and try to
reach the interior of Grinnell land.</p>

<p>With three companions he started from Fort Conger,
April 26, 1882, traveling over ice which was in good condition,
so that the party moved rapidly. Greely found
that two openings along the coast, which he had supposed
to be bays, were large fiords. Here he came
upon layers of remarkably clear fresh-water ice. It
was deep blue in color and contrasted beautifully with
the opaque white ice of the ocean floes. Without doubt a
river or glacier emptied into the fiord. Magnificent mountain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
peaks round about rose to heights of thousands of feet
above the sea level, and through the valleys, which were
bare of snow, there were frequent traces of the musk ox,
the fox, and the hare.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_084">
  <img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Musk Ox.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A sharp turn brought the party to a large icebound lake
about five hundred square miles in area, which Greely
named Lake Hazen. To the north rose ranges of mountains,
snow-covered and majestic, known as the Garfield
range; beyond these lay the United States range, also
snow-covered.</p>

<p>The next day Lake Hazen was crossed and a beautiful
glacier discovered. It was five miles wide, and rose perpendicularly
one hundred and seventy-five feet out of the
lake. Greely named it the Henrietta Nesmith glacier, in
honor of his wife.</p>

<p>The top of this glacier was white, like unpolished marble.
Lower down, the ice shaded into a bluish color,
growing more delicate as it reached the foot, where it
became white, with yellow and rose-colored tinges. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
were three deep gullies or channels in the glacier, through
which a torrent had evidently rushed at some time; and,
strange as it may seem, the hills and slopes next it were
covered with plants, lichens, willows, and Arctic poppies.
In the valleys there was enough vegetation to serve as pasture
for musk oxen and other animals. The interior of
Grinnell land was a pleasant country, and Greely felt sorry
to leave it and return to the coast. He had discovered
and explored a large tract of land never before visited by
civilized men.</p>

<p>In June, 1882, Greely went again to the interior of
Grinnell land. This time he discovered a number of
small lakes, connected by streams with Lake Hazen.</p>

<p>He also made the ascent of a mountain forty-five hundred
feet in height. When he had climbed within half a mile of
the top he was so tired that he felt he must give up. To
urge himself onward, he kept throwing his field glasses
ahead of him, and crawling on his hands and knees to the
spot where they were. At last he could advance only fifty
steps at a time, but he persevered and reached the top, to
which he gave the name Mount Arthur. It is in all probability
the highest peak in Grinnell land, and from its summit
Greely saw the entire island spread out like a map
before him. North of Lake Hazen rose the snow-clad
mountains, extending range beyond range. A like view
met his eye as he surveyed the country to the south, while
in the interior he was gazing upon fertile valleys dotted
with lakes, which supported herds of musk oxen.</p>

<p>Greely spent only twenty minutes on the top of Mount
Arthur. The temperature was far below zero, and he was
in danger of freezing. When he began to descend, he
decided to slide down a precipice a hundred feet in
height, in order to save a long walk around the snowdrifts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Luckily he landed in the soft snow. At the foot of
the mountain Greely met his companions, and they returned
all together to Fort Conger, well pleased with their
journey.</p>

<p>The next year Lieutenant Lockwood crossed Grinnell
land, and on the western coast discovered a large fiord
which he named Greely fiord. Both north and south of
this region were large ice caps, which constantly discharged
glaciers into the lakes and fiords. At Lake Hazen, as well
as at many other places on the island, abandoned Eskimo
huts were found, showing that the Eskimos had at one
time occupied the island; and many relics of these people
were collected, among them a stone lamp, a bone spear-head,
and a sledge. But at this time the island was entirely
uninhabited.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">XIV. FARTHEST NORTH OF THE GREELY
PARTY<br />
<small>1882</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While Greely was exploring Grinnell land, another
party from Fort Conger, under Lieutenant Lockwood, had
forced its way across Robeson channel to the Greenland
coast. Lockwood’s party proceeded northward in the
face of many severe trials. The thermometer registered
81° below the freezing point; add to this rough ice and
severe winds, and we may faintly imagine the suffering
endured.</p>

<p>During a snowstorm the men were obliged to dig a
hole in a snow bank and crawl into it for protection.
But the opening soon filled up with drifting snow, and the
air became so foul that the men were glad to creep out
again. Sometimes the wind blew them over while they
were at work, and once a fierce gust lifted one of the dog
sledges, with its load of two hundred pounds, from the
ground. Nevertheless, on April 27, 1882, the party reached
Cape Bryant, where they camped and proceeded to explore
the surrounding country. The men of the supporting
party, as had been agreed, turned back at this point and
returned to Fort Conger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_088">
  <img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">An Arctic Snowstorm.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Lieutenant Lockwood, Sergeant Brainard, and an
Eskimo named Christianson set off to the north to Cape
Britannia, taking with them enough food to last twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
days. The ice was in fair condition for pushing
rapidly forward, and they soon reached Cape Britannia, a
towering cliff. The men climbed to the top and gazed
around over the snow-covered mountain peaks. Then they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
descended and traveled on over land never before trodden
by white men. They crossed Nordenskjöld inlet and
Chipps inlet, and at length reached a new island, which
was named after Lieutenant Lockwood. It lies in latitude
83° 24ʹ north, but four hundred and fifty miles from the
pole, and was at that time, 1882, the northernmost point
yet attained by any nation.</p>

<p>For three hundred years England had held the honor
of penetrating farthest north. From the time of Henry
Hudson, who, in 1607, reached latitude 81° 30ʹ, the English
sailors had succeeded in going nearer to the pole than
the explorers of any other nation. In 1875, an English
Arctic expedition under Captain Nares, reached latitude
83° 20ʹ north. Now, Lockwood and Brainard had gained
for America the glory of penetrating the farthest north.</p>

<p>From a height of twenty-six hundred feet these two men
saw fields of ice extending to the north as far as the horizon.
To the northeast they saw Cape Washington, which
is twenty-eight miles above Cape Columbia, the most
northern point of Grinnell land. Cape Washington is
the northernmost known limit of Greenland, lying in latitude
83° 38ʹ. After battling so long with the fierce gales
and severe weather, the two men were so exhausted that
they could with difficulty return to the camp. Shortly
after their return it was decided to go back to Fort Conger.
Two of the party were snow-blind and had to be led. The
three brave travelers were greeted with delight by the rest
of the party.</p>

<p>Their success in reaching the highest latitude yet attained
was discussed at every meal. The time passed
rapidly at Fort Conger, for the men were very busy, but
presently they became anxious. The visiting ship which
was expected in the summer of 1882, with supplies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
recruits, did not arrive, and Greely prepared to pass a second
winter at Fort Conger. When August, 1883, came
and no visiting ship had yet made its appearance, it is no
wonder that the men were disheartened.</p>

<p>At length, weary of waiting, and certain that it meant
death to remain a third winter at Fort Conger, Greely
decided to retreat to the south, hoping to meet the ship.
He expected, at least, to find that provisions had been
placed in depots, for his relief. The little steam launch,
the <i>Lady Greely</i>, towed two other small boats through
the narrow channels. Small amounts of food were found
in different caches or depots along the route, though not
enough to bring much relief. The party was now on the
verge of starvation. Only after a desperate struggle did
they succeed in reaching Cape Sabine, where they erected
stone huts and prepared to pass the winter as best they
might. Some of the party tried to hunt, but game had
disappeared and darkness was close upon them. Their
condition was indeed pitiable; their clothing was in rags,
they had no fuel and but forty days’ rations.</p>

<p>But the United States had not forgotten the brave men
who were risking their lives to make her name glorious.
The <i>Neptune</i>, the <i>Proteus</i>, and the <i>Yantic</i> had been sent
to relieve Greely during 1882 and 1883. Every one of
these vessels, however, failed to reach him; moreover,
they neglected to deposit supplies where he might have
found them.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1883 and 1884, under the personal
direction of Secretary Chandler, two vessels, the <i>Thetis</i>
and the <i>Bear</i>, were bought and equipped for the relief of
Greely. The <i>Thetis</i> was commanded by Commodore
W. S. Schley, and sailed from New York on May 1, 1884.
On board the <i>Thetis</i> was Chief Engineer Melville, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
made the heroic search for De Long of the ill-fated <i>Jeannette</i>.
Melville himself had urged this relief expedition for
Greely, and his energy and knowledge brought success.</p>

<p>Congress offered a reward of $25,000 to any vessel
not in the navy, which should first find the missing men,
and many a whaler went north in the attempt to win the
prize. These vessels, though unsuccessful in the search,
did some good, for they helped to break a passage through
the ice.</p>

<p>The men of the <i>Thetis</i>, under Commodore Schley, did not
delay a moment, or wait for favorable leads. When they
could not advance in any other way, they tried to blast
the ice in front and so force a passage. They fought
the ice as they would fight a foe, never swerving from
their one object—to reach Greely in as short a time as
possible. Every possible effort was made, and by June 6
the <i>Thetis</i> reached Melville bay. Little by little she forged
ahead, and reached the neighborhood of Smith sound.</p>

<p>Here all the men who could be spared were sent ashore
to search for records, and at last one of the men came upon
a cairn, which he opened. In it he found a bundle of
Greely’s papers, photographs, and records. The most
recent record was dated September, 1883, nine months
before. It stated that the party had gone into camp
four and a half miles west of Cape Sabine. Commodore
Schley immediately ordered a party of men to take the
steam cutter and find the camp. The <i>Thetis</i> then blew
her whistles to call the search parties back to the ship.</p>

<p>The men of Greely’s party in the wretched tent at
Camp Clay heard the whistles and knew that a vessel
must be somewhere near, yet they were too weak to go in
search of it, and too hopeless to believe that any one was
near enough to find them. One man did crawl out and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
try to raise an oar with three rags on it, as a signal of
distress, but the furious wind tore it down.</p>

<p>The sharp eyes of the men in the steam cutter saw this
man. They ran the boat inshore and were soon questioning
him about his companions. He told them that they
were over the hill, and that seven of them still lived,
among them Lieutenant Greely. The ice pilot jumped out
of the boat and ran to the camp. He was the first of the
party to speak to Lieutenant Greely, as he had been the
last to see him when the <i>Proteus</i> steamed away from Discovery
harbor three years before. Greely directed him to cut
the back out of the tent with his pocket knife. When this
was done, Greely on his hands and knees in his sleeping
bag peered out. His hair and beard were long and matted,
his face was covered with soot and dirt, and his eyes
glittered with excitement. He heard with joy that help
had arrived and that he and his companions were saved.
In the midst of a terrific wind storm, the surviving men
of Greely’s party were transferred to the <i>Thetis</i> and made
comfortable.</p>

<p>Then came the dreadful work of collecting the bodies of
the dead and carrying them aboard the ships, after which
the <i>Thetis</i> and the <i>Bear</i> set sail from Camp Clay and headed
for home. The ship reached Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
August 1, 1884, where Greely and his command were transferred
to the navy yard, while the bodies of the dead were
taken to Governor’s island in New York harbor.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the most successful and rapid relief
voyages ever made. Had Commodore Schley been more
cautious, not a man of Greely’s party would have been
found alive. But Schley knew that this was a time for
both courage and daring, and neither he nor any of his
command lacked in these qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Greely and the other survivors of his expedition received
a royal welcome home. The President of the United
States thanked them publicly on behalf of the nation, the
Queen of England sent messages of inquiry and sympathy,
and the people of Portsmouth held a grand reception in
their honor. The government sent several large war vessels
to the harbor, and Mr. Chandler, Secretary of the Navy, and
other prominent men came with them. The shores of the
river were lined with people and the harbor was filled with
steamers, sailboats, and smaller craft, all gayly decorated
with flags and bunting. Everybody was eager to welcome
the brave men who had risked their lives and suffered
so much in seeking to penetrate still farther into the Frozen
North.</p>

<p>Those members of the expedition who lost their lives in
this journey were not forgotten. A public funeral was
held at Governor’s island, and every respect was paid to
the memories of these men.</p>

<p>The results of Greely’s work in the Arctic regions were
many. The programme for international scientific work
had been carried out daily. All magnetic and climatic
changes had been noted. The effect of the sun’s rays, the
earth and ocean currents, the atmosphere, electricity, ice,
and tides had been observed. A study had been made,
also, of the animal and vegetable life of the locality, and
of the Eskimos.</p>

<p>Both this Circumpolar station and the one established
at Point Barrow were abandoned in 1883, but the value of
the work accomplished through them was very great.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">XV. LIEUTENANT SCHWATKA IN ALASKA<br />
<small>1883</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Alaska was purchased by the United States from Russia
in 1867. It was supposed to be a barren region of ice and
snow, and many people thought that the price of $7,200,000
was an amount far in excess of the value of the land.</p>

<p>For many years no attempt was made to form a territorial
government in Alaska, and the country remained in
charge of the military forces of the United States. In 1883,
Lieutenant Schwatka determined to conduct an exploring
expedition into the interior, for the purpose of gaining such
information of the country and its wild inhabitants as would
be of assistance to the soldiers stationed there. This expedition
did not have the support of Congress and was kept
as secret as possible. Lieutenant Schwatka feared that, if
attention were attracted to the expedition, Congress would
forbid its departure.</p>

<p>All Schwatka’s plans worked well. With six companions
he left Portland, Oregon, at midnight, May 22, and sailed
northward, taking the inland route to Alaska. The inland
route consists of a channel which lies between the coast of
Washington and British Columbia and southeastern Alaska
and the line of islands which lie off that coast.</p>

<p>Sitka, then the capital of Alaska, was reached in a little
more than a week, and two days later the ship dropped
anchor in a pretty port called Pyramid harbor, near the
mouth of the Chilkat river. The villages of the Chilkat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Indians, consisting of from fifteen to fifty houses each, are
built along this river. At these villages Lieutenant Schwatka
secured the services of about sixty Indians to go with him
on his journey.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The party started over a good trail and soon reached
Haines’s mission on Chilkoot inlet. Here more Indians
were added to the number already employed, and the
tramp began over the mountains to the head waters of
the Yukon. At first the party traveled through a riverlike
channel between high, steep mountains, which were
covered nearly to the top with pine, cedar, and spruce
trees. The summits were covered with snow and ice,
which melted and formed cascades and torrents, and
rushed down the slopes, dashing over precipices and flinging
spray in all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>This journey brought them to the mouth of a river called
the Dayay, where they camped. Schwatka now explained
his plan to his Indian guides. He told them that when he
should reach the Yukon, he intended to build a raft and
float down the great river to its mouth. The Indians
were astonished at this bold project. They ridiculed the
idea, saying that no raft could make such a journey.
There were lakes to pass through, they said, and miles of
raging rapids, which would twist and tear any raft to
pieces. But Schwatka paid no attention to their opinions.
He kept steadily on his way, and the journey continued
pleasant and easy through the Dayay river.</p>

<p>On June 10, the course lay over the spurs of the mountains,
and travel became difficult. The trail was up and
down hill, over huge trunks of fallen trees, and through
boggy swamps. Each man carried one hundred pounds
of luggage on his back, and when he sank into a bog up
to his knees, it was far from easy to get out.</p>

<p>The snow line reached, the ascent of the pass over the
Coast range was begun. Behind one another, in single
file, the men scrambled up precipices and through valleys.
Sometimes they crawled along on their hands and
knees, often using their teeth to grasp a dwarf bush.
In many places a single misstep would have resulted in
death, but they persevered and at length succeeded in
crossing the mountains without accident.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_097">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Crossing the Coast Range.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Most of the Indians left Schwatka at this place and
returned to their homes. Those who were to accompany
him down the Yukon river to the coast camped with the
white men, late in the evening, by a small lake called by
Schwatka, Crater lake. It is the source of the great
Yukon river.</p>

<p>At Lake Lindeman the raft was built, and the stores<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
and provisions were placed upon it. Then began the
longest raft journey ever made for purposes of exploration.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Schwatka and his companions propelled the
raft, by means of rowing and sculling, through Lake Lindeman
into another lake called Bennett lake. On the mountains
around Bennett lake were beautiful blue glaciers,
and among them shone peaks and ridges of a reddish
color. Schwatka concluded that the red color was due
to the presence of iron in the soil, and he accordingly
named the range the Iron-capped mountains.</p>

<p>The explorers now traveled through a chain of lakes
connected by streams of water. The last lake led them
into the Yukon river, which flowed rapidly, so that for a
while the raft made good time. On July 1, the party
came in sight of the upper end of the Grand Cañon of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
Yukon, where the river, which had been about three hundred
yards in width, grew narrower, until it was about
thirty yards wide.</p>

<p>The walls of the cañon are nearly a mile in length and
are perpendicular columns of rock. The center of this
cañon expands into a large basin full of whirlpools and
eddies. The waters, white with foam, tear through this
narrow passage of rock at the rate of six or seven miles
an hour, with a roaring that can be heard at a great
distance.</p>

<p>At the northern end of the cañon the rushing river
widens again, but for four miles it seethes, foams, and
falls in cascades. The luggage was sent round by portage,
and Schwatka prepared to shoot his raft through the
rapids. Once started, the men could not control or guide
the raft at all, but left it to work its own way. This it did
very successfully, though many times they thought it would
surely be dashed in pieces.</p>

<p>After the rapids were passed, the men drew the sturdy
raft ashore, and found that it needed but few repairs.
While some of the men were engaged in mending the raft,
the others fished. Schwatka found this the best fishing
ground on the entire river; in a short time between
four and five hundred fine grayling were caught with rod
and fly.</p>

<p>The raft was ready for use again by July 5, and on that
day Schwatka and his party started once more down the
Yukon, and soon passed through the last lake they were to
encounter. After this the river became wider and was
dotted with islands; then the site of old Fort Selkirk came
into view.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_099">
  <img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Tanana Station, River Yukon, in Winter.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Fort Selkirk was built in 1850 by the Hudson Bay Trading
Company for a trading post with the Indians. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the Chilkats wanted the furs from the interior for themselves;
so they gathered a war party together, descended
the Yukon river to Fort Selkirk, burned the building, and
carried off the goods. Now all that remains of Fort
Selkirk is a group of three old chimneys.</p>

<p>Schwatka camped at this spot several days. Near the
river bank he came upon a burial ground of the Ayan
Indians, who inhabit this part of the country. A fence of
rough boards, bound together by willows, is built around
each grave. Above the grave there stands a long, light
pole about twenty feet high, with a piece of colored cloth
hanging from the top. Near the grave, but outside the
inclosure, stands another pole of about the same height.
To the top of this second pole is fastened a rude carving
of a fish, duck, goose, bear, or some other animal or bird.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>These poles are called totems. They represent the most
clever workmanship of these Indians, and are collected
and sold as curiosities. Some of the carvings are very old
and display remarkable skill. No one knows exactly what
these totem poles mean, as the Indians are unwilling to
talk about them, but they are supposed to indicate in some
way the history of the buried person or of his tribe. The
Indians do not make totem poles any more, but they carefully
preserve those which they already have.</p>

<p>At Fort Selkirk the Yukon begins to cut through the
northern spurs of the Rocky mountains. This part of the
river is known as the Upper Ramparts, and the scenery
along the banks for one hundred miles is wondrously
beautiful. Schwatka and his party left Selkirk July 15,
and traveled through this beautiful country. As they
rounded one of the islands, they saw about two hundred
Ayan Indians gathered on the beach opposite, waiting to
receive them.</p>

<p>The Ayans had heard of the approach of the curious
raft with its white owners, and were anxious to show them
some attention. Many of the Indians ran up and down
the bank, shouting, screaming, and waving their arms
wildly. Others in birch-bark canoes surrounded the raft,
and escorted it to shore. When the raft came near the
shore, men, women, and children waded out to their waists
in the ice-cold water and helped to drag it in. Schwatka
feared at first that the Indians might do the party some
harm, and ordered his companions to keep their guns near.
But the Indians were very friendly. They began singing
and dancing, while their medicine-man went through the
most unheard-of performances.</p>

<p>The Ayan huts are made of spruce brush. Over the
top is thrown a piece of dirty canvas or a moose or caribou<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
skin, and the huts are built so low that a man can scarcely
stand erect inside. Quantities of salmon hang from the
roof, partly dried, but still undergoing a smoking process
from the dense clouds of smoke that arise from the fire.
The dogs sleep in the house, lying around on the floor.
In the winter the Ayans cover their tents thickly with
skins and then bank them about with snow.</p>

<p>As the party followed the river from this Indian village,
they found the mountains becoming higher and grander,
while—by way of contrast—the mosquitoes grew more
annoying. The whole region swarmed with them, and the
newcomers longed for veils. They were obliged to use
small bushes to brush away the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The water of the Yukon became very muddy, so that it
was impossible to fish with a rod and fly. At the Yukon
flat lands, reached by our travelers after three weeks of
traveling through this flat region, the river widened and
was filled with low, sandy islands. The fort is situated on a
curve of the river which happens to be almost directly
upon the Arctic circle, and is called the Great Arctic bend.</p>

<p>Fort Yukon is about one thousand miles from the mouth
of the river, which at this point is seven miles wide. The
river steamer, named the <i>Yukon</i>, was moored at the fort,
and her cannon greeted the raftsmen. The settlement
consists of a few old houses and the old fort built by the
Hudson Bay Company. The Fort Yukon tribe of Indians
live in the vicinity, but the hunting and fishing are poor,
and the tribe is small and nomadic.</p>

<p>After the river men had traded with the Indians the
steamer proceeded upstream, while Schwatka and his
party started downstream again on the raft. In a little
while the country began to grow hilly once more, greatly
to the delight of the travelers, for the low region had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
unendurably dreary. The hilly region is known as the
Lower Ramparts, and its scenery is much like that of the
Upper Ramparts.</p>

<p>Another trading station was soon reached, where
Schwatka saw the northernmost garden in the United
States. This garden, within two days’ journey of the
polar regions, belonged to the white man who was in
charge of the station at that point. In it were growing
turnips and other hardy vegetables, which tasted delicious
to the men, who had been living so long upon canned
foods.</p>

<p>The raft was laid away at this place, after its journey of
thirteen hundred and three miles, and the party embarked
on a schooner, hoping to make better time. But they were
forced to work their way down the river inch by inch, for
heavy winds sprang up and more than once threatened to
wreck the schooner. The <i>Yukon</i> at last overtook them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
on her return to the mouth of the river, as Schwatka had
expected.</p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The Raft on which a Journey of Thirteen Hundred and Three
Miles was made.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The great delta of the Yukon soon came into view. It
consists of many islands and channels which have never
been entirely explored. From the most northern mouth
of the delta to the most southern is a distance of ninety
miles. After the Alphoon, the northernmost mouth, was
reached, a weary time began. The vessel slowly threaded
her way through shallow channels of water and between
mud banks, until she crept into the harbor of the little
village of St. Michael on the coast. From this place
Schwatka and his party embarked for San Francisco on
the <i>Leo</i>, which had stopped at St. Michael on its way from
Point Barrow.</p>

<p>By this raft journey of Lieutenant Schwatka, the Yukon
was navigated from its source to its mouth, a distance of
two thousand and forty-four miles.</p>

<p>This river is the fifth in length in the United States,
and sends forth such a volume of water that it freshens
Bering sea to a distance of ten miles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">XVI. NANSEN CROSSES GREENLAND<br />
<small>1888</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Schwatka had explored the interior of Alaska, but the
interior of Greenland remained as great a mystery as ever.
The only man who had attempted to cross the inland
region was Nordenskjöld, who had penetrated only a few
miles.</p>

<p>In 1888 a young Norwegian named Fridtjof Nansen
determined to cross the ice cap of Greenland.</p>

<p>Nansen was an expert in the use of the ski. Ski are
Norwegian snowshoes. They consist of long, narrow
strips of wood, which are fastened to the shoes in about
the same way in which we fasten skates. The ski are
about eight feet in length and three or four inches in
breadth. In front they are slightly pointed and curved
up; often the back is pointed also. A man who is skillful
in the use of ski can travel over the snow by means of
them at a rate of eight or nine miles an hour. In Norway
and in some other cold countries, where the snow lies deep
a larger part of the year, ski are much used for traveling.</p>

<p>The people of Norway love the sport of ski-löbning.
During the long winter the boys and the girls go to and
from school on ski. At recess they take a run on their ski,
and often the teacher goes with them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_105">
  <img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Man on Ski.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Nansen learned to use the ski when a boy, and after
he was grown up he took great pleasure in strapping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
these queer shoes to his feet and trying to climb the high
mountains.</p>

<p>One day this question came suddenly into Nansen’s mind:
Why might not a party of good ski-löbners cross Greenland
from coast to coast? After thinking the matter over
for a time, Nansen concluded that it could be done. From
that moment he devoted all his time and energy to carrying
out his idea. He decided that the best plan would
be to start from the east coast and travel across to the
west. The east coast was barren and uninhabited. Sometimes
a few wandering Eskimo tribes found their way
there, but no settlements had been made. On the western
coast there were settlements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>Nansen knew that if his party landed on the east coast
and traveled west, they would travel toward safety. If
this route were reversed, they would leave comfort and
safety behind at every step, and move continually toward
unknown dangers. The men might become discouraged,
give up the expedition, and return to the settlements. So
Nansen coolly made his plans
to land on the east coast and
cross Greenland to the west
coast. By this arrangement
the men would perceive that
they must reach the west
coast or die.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="i_106">
  <img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Fridtjof Nansen.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The government of Norway
would not assist Nansen.
His plan was considered that
of a madman. Many people
said that he was attempting
to do an impossible thing.
Others said, “Of what use is
this exploit, even if he does
succeed?” These people did
not know that a large portion
of our earth was once
ice-covered, as Greenland is
to-day. If we would know the cause of many curious phenomena
that now exist in our own land, we must study
Greenland. As Greenland is now, so, probably, was a large
part of the earth during the ice age, thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Though Nansen met with discouragements on every
side, he continued to plan for the trip. At length a
wealthy Danish gentleman gave him enough money to
equip an expedition. It was not easy for Nansen to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
companions for this journey, but he at length succeeded
in securing the services of three Norwegians and two
Lapps. The Norwegians were Otto Sverdrup, a retired
ship captain, Oluf Dietrichson, a lieutenant in the army,
and Kristian Kristiansen Trana, a peasant. The Lapps
were named Balto and Ravna. Balto was a good-looking
young man, who spoke a little English; he was a sea Lapp
and lived in a town. Ravna was a mountain Lapp, forty-five
years of age. He was short, and had long, black hair
hanging over his shoulders. Ravna’s home was on the
mountains, where he lived in a skin tent and took care of
herds of reindeer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_107">
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Herd of Reindeer.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Nansen made sure that all these five men were skillful
ski-löbners, for he thought that, when they reached the
inland ice of Greenland, the journey would be rapid and
easy on ski.</p>

<p>Then Nansen arranged with the captain of a sealing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
vessel to carry him and his companions to the Arctic
ocean. After collecting tents, clothing, food, sleeping
bags, and scientific instruments, the party proceeded to
Iceland, where the captain of the sealing vessel had
promised to call for them. On June 3, 1888, the sealing
vessel, the <i>Jason</i>, arrived off the coast of Iceland, and
Nansen and his companions were taken aboard. The
<i>Jason</i> headed directly for Denmark strait, where seals
abound, and in a short time the ship was among the
ice floes. Every one on board was watching eagerly for
seals, and at last a large number of the quiet creatures
were seen lying like black dots on the floes.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Jason</i> there was great excitement. The
men flew about, making sure that rifles were clean and in
good order and that cartridge boxes were filled. Then the
hunters rushed to the boats and the capture began. One
hundred and eighty-seven seals were shot that day. The
sealers thought this a small number, but Nansen, who had
never hunted seals before, thought it a very good day’s
sport.</p>

<p>Sealing vessels, in their efforts to make large hauls,
usually push steadily on through the ice, until they are in
the midst of crowds of seals. The force of the ice against
the ship is often so great as to throw the sailors off their
feet. When the vessel is well in among the seals the
engines are stopped, and the men are ordered to start out
in the small boats. There are three or four oarsmen with
one shooter in each boat. Away they go in different directions,
each boat trying to secure the greatest number it can
carry and to return first to the ship. The seals lie all
around on the edges of the ice floes, and at first pay no
attention to the boats. They lift their heads and see the
boats coming from a long distance away; then, ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of their danger, they lower their heads again and lie
quiet.</p>

<p>As the boats draw nearer, the seals sometimes slide off
into the water. The hunters are quick to see any movement
on the part of the seals. As soon as one moves
toward the water, the men in the boat begin to shout as
loudly as they can. The seal is so astonished by the unusual
noise that he lies still awhile to think it over.</p>

<p>Then the hunter takes aim, and if he shoots the animal
through the head, it drops down on the ice again and dies.
The other seals near by are not disturbed. They seem to
think that their companion has gone quietly to sleep again,
and that there can be no danger. Often several seals are
shot in this way before the rest become alarmed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shooter misses his mark and wounds the
seal instead of killing him instantly. The wounded seal
in his pain splashes around on the ice and in the water,
and the others take fright and plunge into the sea. A
great deal, therefore, depends upon the skill of the shooters,
most of whom are accurate marksmen.</p>

<p>When several seals have been shot, the men in the boat
spring to the floes where they are lying and skin them.
The skinning is done rapidly with long, sharp knives, and
nothing is saved except the skin and the layer of blubber
lying next it. The entire body of the seal is left on the ice.
The Eskimos would think this practice very wasteful, for
they make use of every part of the seal, including the bones.</p>

<p>As sealers sometimes return from a trip to Denmark
strait with five thousand skins aboard, it is not surprising
that seals are becoming scarce in that locality.</p>

<p>Nansen was glad when the haul of seals was over and
the <i>Jason</i> steamed away again toward Greenland. Several
times the coast had been sighted, but the ship had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
drawn near enough to make it possible to land. Balto
was not very well pleased with his first glimpse of Greenland.
In his account of his voyage, he said that the coast
had no beauty nor charm to the eye, but was dismal and
hideous to look upon; that the mountain peaks were very
high and rose like church steeples into the clouds, which
hid the summits.</p>

<p>But Nansen thought the coast beautiful. The snow-covered
peaks glittered in the sunlight and extended as
far as the eye could reach, while far to the west stretched
the vast white plain of inland ice.</p>

<p>On July 17, 1888, as the <i>Jason</i> was not more than ten or
twelve miles from the coast of Greenland, Nansen made
up his mind to leave the ship. All the baggage was
brought on deck, farewells were said, and at seven o’clock
in the evening Nansen and his five companions climbed
down the ship’s ladder and embarked in two boats. The
<i>Jason’s</i> guns saluted; the <i>Jason’s</i> crew cheered. But deep
down in their hearts the sailors believed that Nansen and
his men were going to certain death. No thought of fear,
however, disturbed the brave band. With the exception of
Balto and Ravna, they were all delighted to enter upon
the perilous journey.</p>

<p>At first everything went well. There were channels of
water between the floes, wide enough for the boats to pass
through. But soon the ice began to pack, and the boats
had to be pulled up upon the floes and dragged across to
open water. It was hard to keep the light craft from
being crushed between the ice masses. Then the current
became so strong that the men were obliged to draw the
boats up on a floe, in order to escape from it.</p>

<p>The ice which had collected around them threw the
smaller floes upon the larger ones, making the ice uneven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
and difficult to traverse. After working all night, the men
crawled into their sleeping bags, and were soon asleep.</p>

<p>For several days little progress was made toward land.
Then a heavy swell arose and the breakers dashing over
the floe where the tent had been pitched threatened to
wash it away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_111">
  <img src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Nansen’s Camp on the Drift Ice.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the floe split through the middle, and the
travelers were obliged to remove to a larger one and camp
again. The tent stood now on a piece of drifting ice,
about ten miles from land, with every prospect of being
carried out to sea, where small boats could not live in the
heavy waves. The outlook was certainly gloomy.</p>

<p>One morning Nansen missed Balto and Ravna. In
searching for them he lifted the canvas covering of one of
the boats, and saw the two Lapps lying in the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
the boat, side by side. Balto was reading to Ravna from
his Lappish New Testament, for both had made up their
minds that they must drown, and were preparing for death.</p>

<p>That day the ice tilted and rolled like a raft on the
angry waves, so that it was almost impossible to cook
the soup for their dinner. The poor frightened Lapps
did not speak a word, but the rest of the men knew no
fear, and laughed and joked as usual.</p>

<p>When night came, all the men, except Balto and Sverdrup,
went to bed in the tent; Balto preferred to sleep in
a boat, and Sverdrup was to keep watch.</p>

<p>Slowly and calmly, brave Otto Sverdrup paced up and
down the ice. The floe rocked like a ship at sea, and the
heavy waves dashed over it, threatening to wash away the
entire camp. Several times Sverdrup was obliged to hold
the boat in which Balto was sleeping, to keep it from
being swept off the ice. Once it seemed that the tent
must be washed off also, and Sverdrup stepped up to it
and unfastened one of the hooks. He meant to call the
men, so that they might get into the boats, and, if possible,
escape with their lives. But Sverdrup paused a
moment. The sea seemed to grow quieter, and a current
arose which quieted the breakers and changed the course
of the drifting ice, which, instead of sailing out to sea, now
floated in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>When Nansen awoke in the morning, he was surprised
to find the open sea far off, and the ice drifting calmly
toward the land. All the party rejoiced that they had
remained on the ice, which at one time seemed so dangerous.
Their safety was due to the fearlessness and
calm judgment of Sverdrup.</p>

<p>The work of launching the boats and dragging them
over the ice continued for a week longer. One morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Nansen was resting quietly in his tent, when Ravna, who
was on watch without, pulled aside the canvas and peered
in. He appeared so excited that Nansen asked him if he
could see land. “Yes, yes,” replied Ravna, “land too
near!”—meaning, “land very near.” Nansen sprang
from his sleeping bag and looked out. Land was very
near, and there was open water in front of them. The
boats were quickly launched. After some hours of hard
pulling the party found a harbor and landed.</p>

<p>The voyagers rejoiced to be on land once more. They
walked over the stones and rocks, and picked moss and a
stalk or two of grass. They had a good dinner to celebrate
the landing: biscuit, cheese, and jam to eat, and hot
chocolate to drink. When dinner was over, they started
north again in boats along the coast, for Nansen wished to
begin his journey across Greenland farther to the north
than the place where he had landed.</p>

<p>The travelers picked their way on along the coast until a
great glacier came in sight, which Nansen knew to be the
famous Puisortok. Puisortok means the place where something
shoots up, and the Eskimos regard the spot with fear.
When they pass this dreadful place they will not speak,
laugh, eat, nor smoke. They will not look toward the glacier,
or even mention the name Puisortok. They believe
that if they do any of these things the glacier will become
angry and cause their death.</p>

<p>Balto was one day gazing through the telescope near
this place, when he saw two small black spots in the distance
which seemed to be moving rapidly toward him. As
they grew more distinct, he shouted to Nansen that two
men were coming. When they came nearer, the strangers
proved to be two young East Greenland Eskimos traveling
through the ice floes in their kayaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>These Eskimos were short in stature and very good-looking.
Their faces were broad and round, and their features
regular. Their skin was chestnut-brown, and their hair
long, black, and shiny. One wore a jacket and breeches
of sealskin, with strings of beads in his hair, while the other
wore sealskin trousers and a jacket of blue cotton. On
their heads they wore large flat-brimmed hats, made of
blue cotton stretched across a wooden ring. On the crown
was a large red cross.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_114">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A Group of Greenland Eskimos.</span></p>
    <p class="noic"><small>After photograph by Nansen.</small></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Eskimos showed great astonishment at the boats
and other strange things that they saw, and when Nansen
gave them some food, they seemed much pleased. By<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
gestures they warned Nansen about the dangerous Puisortok,
and then set off northward again in their kayaks.</p>

<p>Nansen and his men passed Puisortok without any
trouble, though they talked and laughed as usual. They
looked at the dreaded glacier, and admired the beautiful
color of the ice, which shaded from blue to a milky white.
Yet old Puisortok showed no signs of anger. Soon the
wayfarers came upon an Eskimo camp. High up among
the rocks stood the skin tents, while the Eskimos themselves
were gathered outside, running about in a highly excited
manner, chattering and waving their arms. As the boats
came nearer, the people on the land yelled and shrieked.
Some ran to the shore, and some to high points on rocks,
where they could get a better view of the strangers.</p>

<p>They welcomed the newcomers with smiles of delight,
and helped them in every possible way. Nansen and his
friends were invited into the Eskimo tents. They remained
inside as long as possible, but the filth soon drove
them out. When Nansen and his men went to bed in
their own tent, the Eskimos stood around in crowds, gaping
curiously to see them undress and crawl into their
sleeping bags.</p>

<p>The Eskimos gave the white men pieces of sealskin, and
in return their guests presented them with the empty tin
cans in which their meat had been packed. These gifts
pleased the natives very much. They contrived to make
Nansen understand that two tribes, one traveling north
and the other south, had met at this place, and that now
they were preparing to separate and continue their journey.
Nansen determined to accompany the tribe which was
going north, because he thought that their knowledge of
the coast might be of assistance to him.</p>

<p>The accomplished Eskimos were not long in preparing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
for the journey. In a twinkling the tents were down and
everything was packed. Before they parted, the members
of the different tribes bade one another good-by, rubbing
their noses together, instead of kissing. A few
remained behind the others for a specially tender farewell.
They drew up in a line like soldiers, and brought out snuff
horns. One man would take snuff from a horn, and pass
it on to the next. They spent several hours in this ceremony,
each man taking snuff many times. Nansen
thought they would sneeze themselves to death.</p>

<p>Only the Eskimos who had come from the south had their
horns full of snuff. The tribe from the north was bound
for the Danish colonies on the southern coast, to procure
this important article. The journey takes about two years,
one year to reach the Danish colonies, and one year to
return. When the colonies are reached, the Eskimos
spend an hour or two in trading. After they obtain the
snuff, they start on their homeward journey. Their form
of snuff is simply tobacco, ground to a powder between
stones. In exchange for the tobacco, the Eskimos give
large, fine bearskins, foxskins, and sealskins. They pay
high prices for articles which cost the white men very
little money.</p>

<p>When the farewell was over, the Eskimos parted, and
Nansen tried to keep the north-bound travelers in sight, but
he soon found that he must depend upon himself and break
his own way through the ice. The journey grew harder
and harder, and in camp the travelers were often tormented
by swarms of mosquitoes. Clouds of the small insects
swarmed around them and annoyed the men almost beyond
endurance. Any amount of work in the ice was to be preferred
to an attack by mosquitoes.</p>

<p>The party traveled through the water among huge icebergs;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
they plodded wearily over ice hummocks; finally,
they drew up their boats for the last time at a place where
Nansen thought they could climb the steep ascent from
the coast, and reach the inland ice.</p>

<p>The boats were left in a cleft in the rocks, carefully
blocked with stones to keep them steady. Then began
the climb up the mountains to the plateau. The ascent
was steep, and the men had hard work to drag up the
sledges. Often one of the climbers would sink into a deep
crevasse and have to be rescued by his companions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_117">
  <img src="images/i_117.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">A View in the Interior of Greenland.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The crevasses grew deeper and more dangerous as the
party advanced, and soon a rain storm set in, which delayed
the travelers three days. While they were lying in the tents,
the men followed the wise example of the bears and did no
work. They ate very little and only once a day, but slept
a great deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>When they took up the journey again, they found the
ice hard. But a heavy snowstorm began, and it was difficult
to drag the sledges through the deep drifts. At last,
when they reached a point six thousand feet above the
level of the sea, the wind was blowing fiercely and the temperature
stood at zero.</p>

<p>Nansen decided to rig a sail for the sledges, hoping
by this contrivance to make the wind serve as an aid.
Old Ravna was disgusted with the plan, and Balto, too,
thought it absurd to try to sail on the snow. But Nansen
made the sails, and the two Lapps were soon forced to
admit that their use made the load lighter to draw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_118">
  <img src="images/i_118.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Sledging across Greenland.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The snow was still very deep, and when, on August 30,
it was in condition for the men to use the ski, they joyfully
strapped them on. In a short time they had attained the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
plateau, and then for days they toiled over a flat, wide
expanse of snow. The highest elevation which Nansen
reached during this journey was nine thousand two hundred
and seventy-two feet, and the lowest temperature he
experienced was 49° below zero.</p>

<p>The sledges were heavy, and the Lapps grumbled all the
time, Ravna especially being very low-spirited. One day
he said to Nansen: “I am an old Lapp, and a silly
old fool, too. I don’t believe we shall ever get to the
coast.”</p>

<p>Nansen answered: “That is quite true, Ravna. You are
a silly old fool.”</p>

<p>Ravna’s spirits grew lighter when the party reached the
highest part of the plateau and began to descend, for then
they went along swiftly on their ski, or coasted down the
slopes. Sometimes they encountered crevasses and had to
pick their way carefully, and once Nansen fell into a deep
chasm and had to scramble desperately to get out. When
the bare rocks came in view, Ravna was so delighted that
he insisted upon carrying a double load. He said that the
mountain grasses and the reindeer moss reminded him of
his own mountains at home.</p>

<p>At last the travelers reached the sea and encamped in
a sheltered valley. Nansen and Sverdrup built a rude boat
and embarked for Godthaab, the nearest town on the coast,
whence they sent back natives to bring their comrades to
town.</p>

<p>The Greenlanders took the two Lapps for women, because
of their long tunics of reindeer skin. But Ravna
and Balto did not resent this mistake; they were perfectly
happy now and at ease. They told the natives about the
wonderful things that they had seen during the journey
over the inland ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>Nansen was sadly disappointed when he heard that he
could not sail for home until the spring, for the ship on
which he had hoped to sail had already gone. He sent
two swift kayak travelers with letters, to try to overtake the
ship at another town where she was to stop.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_120">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Skating off the Coast of Greenland.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Nansen and his companions spent the winter comfortably
at Godthaab. They found plenty to keep them busy.
Nansen learned to use the kayak skillfully; he hunted
and fished, and made two trips upon the inland ice.</p>

<p>In the spring, when the ship arrived which was to take
them home, all the party felt sorry to part with the good
friends they had made in Greenland. The farewells over,
Nansen was soon homeward bound. On May 30, 1888,
the ship entered Christiania fiord. The harbor was filled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
with steamers and sailing vessels, all crowded with people,
assembled to greet the man who had succeeded in crossing
the inland ice of Greenland. Flags were waved, bells
rung, and cheers were given with a will, to show the honor
which Norway would pay her son, Fridtjof Nansen.</p>

<p>When Nansen had disembarked and entered a carriage
to be driven home, the people were so excited that they
dashed forward, unharnessed the horses from the carriage,
and seizing the pole, drew him in triumph through the
city.</p>

<p>The scientific and geographical results of this journey of
Nansen’s were very great. Much valuable knowledge
was gained concerning the character of the interior of
Greenland.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">XVII. THE VOYAGE OF THE <i>FRAM</i><br />
<small>1893–1896</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Nansen had not been at home very long before he began
making preparations for a second voyage to the icy North.
This time he meant to find the North Pole if possible.</p>

<p>Nansen believed the theory that a current in the Arctic
ocean passes over the pole. His plan was to work his way
through the ice to the New Siberia islands, and then allow
his vessel to be frozen in the ice pack. He believed that
the vessel would be carried with the drift across the pole,
to the east coast of Greenland. It was a daring plan, but
the people of Norway now believed in Nansen and were
willing to assist him. They gave him an amount equal to
$75,600 of our money, so that he was able to equip his
expedition.</p>

<p>First of all he had a vessel built which would resist ice
pressures. The hull was shaped so that the pressure would
raise the vessel up on the ice, instead of crushing her.
This vessel was called the <i>Fram</i>, a Norwegian word which
means “onward.” Nansen chose his crew, all natives of
Norway, and made the necessary preparations for the
voyage. Enough provisions were put on board to last
five years. Sverdrup, who had been so brave and helpful
during the trip across Greenland, was chosen to command
the <i>Fram</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>At last everything was ready, and the day of departure
arrived. The <i>Fram</i> was lying in Christiania harbor
when Nansen boarded her (1893). While they were
still sailing along the coast of Norway, a severe storm
arose. The sea broke over the rails of the vessel, and
for a while Nansen feared that the deck cargo would be
carried overboard, and that the <i>Fram</i> would meet with
disaster before she reached the ice. But the storm cleared,
the sun shone again, and the men had a last glimpse of
their native land.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_123">
  <img src="images/i_123.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The Launching of the “Fram.”</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then a dense fog surrounded the vessel, and she headed
for the dreaded Kara sea. The Kara sea was filled with
ice, but the <i>Fram</i> behaved admirably. Nansen said that it
was a pleasure to take her into difficult ice, because she
was so strong, and that she turned and twisted as easily as
a ball on a plate.</p>

<p>The <i>Fram</i> proceeded along the bleak Siberian coast. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
morning a herd of walruses came in sight. Nansen and
two companions jumped into a boat and went after them.
One of the men threw a harpoon at the nearest walrus, but
did not hit him. This proceeding so startled the other walruses
that they plunged into the water, but not before Nansen
had shot two of them. They rose again around the
boat, bellowing and roaring, and lashing the sea into a foam.
It seemed likely that the powerful animals would overturn
the boat or pierce it with their tusks. But no accident
happened, and Nansen secured several walruses, which
served as food for the crew.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_124">
  <img src="images/i_124.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Boat attacked by Walrus.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By September 25, 1893, they had reached the New Siberia
islands, where the <i>Fram</i> was unable to push her way farther,
and was soon frozen in the pack. Now there was nothing
to do but to wait. At first the time passed pleasantly
enough. The men amused themselves by playing games,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
caring for the dogs, taking observations, and making
various kinds of tools; but soon they had to bestir themselves,
for on October 5, the first severe ice pressure took
place.</p>

<p>Nansen was in the cabin chatting with his companions,
when they heard a terrific noise and felt the ship tremble
from bow to stern. Every one rushed to the deck to see how
the <i>Fram</i> would conduct herself. The noise steadily increased,
and the ice cracked on every side. The sea tossed
the floes, which were from ten to fifteen feet thick, one upon
another, until immense piles of ice were heaped around.
The <i>Fram</i> quivered all over and then was lifted gently up.
After a few moments the uproar had ceased, and the ship
sank slowly down again into her old position. Nansen was
delighted, because the <i>Fram</i> had behaved during the nip
just as he had hoped. Had she not risen and pushed the
floes down beneath her, she would have been crushed
among them.</p>

<p>The autumn passed away pleasantly. Polar bears were
numerous, and the men enjoyed the sport of hunting them.
When Christmas (1893) came, the day was celebrated by
a very good dinner. The men made speeches and gave
one another Christmas gifts. They did not dream that
another Christmas would find them still drifting, with the
knowledge that little headway had been made.</p>

<p>At last Nansen made up his mind to leave the ship and
journey by sledge with one of his companions toward the
North Pole. All the crew set to work to prepare for this
dangerous trip. The dogs were exercised and trained,
sledges and kayaks were built, and provisions weighed
out and packed. The weather was bitterly cold, the wind
blew fiercely, and ice pressures were increasing in number
and severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>On January 3, 1895, the <i>Fram</i> encountered the most severe
pressure which she had to meet. The accumulated
floes formed a ridge of ice which reached to the ship and
was level with the rails. Masses of ice dashed over the
decks, and the crashing and grinding were terrible to hear.</p>

<p>Nansen feared that the ship would be crushed, and
orders were given to put everything in a place of safety.
But the stanch vessel held her own, and came out of the
pressure safely. When the danger was over, the <i>Fram</i> was
found to be uninjured, but one of her sides was buried
in the ice mound, which reached six feet above the rails.</p>

<p>About two months later, Nansen set out upon his daring
trip toward the pole. He took Johansen with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
left the <i>Fram</i>, then in latitude 84° north, in command of
Otto Sverdrup. The journey northward had to be made
over difficult ice filled with hummocks, and, worse than
this, a southerly drift set in, which carried the whole pack
south almost as fast as they traveled north. Many of the
dogs became utterly exhausted and had to be killed. It
made Nansen very sad to be obliged to part with the
faithful animals who had helped him so much.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_126">
  <img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Nansen and Johansen leaving the “Fram.”</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>At night Nansen and Johansen were so tired that they
often fell asleep while eating their supper. When they
crept into their sleeping bags, their clothes were sometimes
frozen stiff, but the heat of their bodies in their bags thawed
them out.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these hardships, Nansen and his
companion succeeded in reaching 86° 14ʹ north latitude on
April 8, 1895. This was the highest latitude so far reached
by any explorer. The North Pole was but two hundred
and sixty-one miles farther north. Nansen knew he could
not reach the pole through such masses of floes and hummocks,
and accordingly he decided to return, changing his
course to the south. The travelers found many channels
between the ice floes, which were difficult to cross. The
dogs were now so few in number that the men had to do
dogs’ work, and drag the sledges. The ice became soft,
so that the ski and the sledges sank deep into it. Sometimes
the men sank in up to their armpits.</p>

<p>Nansen’s report of this journey has led many people to
believe that the warm and the cold ocean currents meet at
the pole, and that the effect of the united currents is
to make the ice rotten and dangerous for travel. Some
explorers believe that it is impossible to travel the last
hundred miles of the journey toward the pole by sledge
or boat. They think that the ice is too soft for sledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
travel, and too compact for travel by boat. If this be
true, a balloon or airship will have to be used in order
to reach the pole. It is no wonder that Nansen and
Johansen became discouraged.</p>

<p>By June 30, 1895, the two explorers were certain that
they would have to pass the winter in the ice. Nansen
knew that he must secure some game, for his provisions
would not last through the winter; therefore he and
Johansen pushed on south as fast as they could, and at
last shot a seal and a bear. Only two dogs were left, and
at length they too had to be shot. One dog was Nansen’s
favorite, and the other was Johansen’s. Nansen took
Johansen’s dog behind a hummock, and Johansen did
the same with Nansen’s. Then both guns were fired
together and the faithful dogs were dead. This was the
hardest thing these two men had to do during the journey.
When they met again, they felt so sad that neither of them
could speak.</p>

<p>One day, while looking through the telescope, Nansen
saw land in the distance. The two men hastened toward
it, and for the first time in two years they felt the naked
earth beneath their feet. It was summer, and seals, birds,
and flowers were all about them. In front lay the open
sea, and Nansen thought he might sail on, and perhaps
reach home. But he was disappointed, for after sailing a
short distance, he again found ice and was obliged to
return.</p>

<p>It was now certain that Nansen and Johansen would
have to pass the winter on the island, and they began their
preparations for it. They built a hut of stone, and stretched
walrus hides over the roof and floor. Fortunately game
was plenty, so that they shot many seals and walruses.
The blubber of the walrus was a favorite article of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
diet, for in cold countries men long for fatty food. It
was so cold that often Nansen and Johansen had to sleep
in the same bag in order to keep warm. Sometimes they
drew pieces of blubber out of the lamp and ate them.
These favorite dainties they called biscuit. The walrus
hides attracted the bears and foxes to the hut, so that often
during the winter the men succeeded in securing fresh
meat.</p>

<p>The winter was a long and weary one. Though Christmas,
1895, found them rather low-spirited, they made up
their minds to observe the day. Their celebration consisted
of reversing their shirts, and treating themselves to bread
and chocolate. They broke up their camp in the spring
(May, 1896), and started southward by water.</p>

<p>During this trip Nansen nearly lost his life. The men
left their kayaks one day fastened to the edge of the ice,
while they went to the top of a hummock to look around.
Presently Johansen shouted, “The kayaks are adrift.”
Both men rushed for the water, and Nansen, reaching it
first, jumped in and swam for the boats. The water was
terribly cold and the boats had drifted a long distance, but
Nansen knew that the loss of the boats meant death to him
and his companion. He swam as long as he could, and
then lay on his back and floated, to rest. Again he tried
to swim, but his limbs became stiff and numb so that he
could scarcely move them. Feebly he pushed on until he
succeeded in grasping a ski which was lying across the
bow, and so drawing the kayak to him. It was almost
more than his chilled and weary body could accomplish to
pull himself into one of the boats and paddle back. Johansen,
who was anxiously watching, expected every moment
to see his companion sink down unconscious. But Nansen’s
iron will and strength conquered. Johansen gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Nansen a warm drink, and put him to bed in his sleeping
bag.</p>

<p>Two days later Nansen went walrus hunting, and had
another narrow escape. One of the walruses stuck his
tusks through the side of the kayak and nearly upset it,
but Nansen struck the walrus with the paddle until he
loosed his hold and swam away.</p>

<p>Shortly after this adventure, Nansen was one day standing
on a hummock, looking round over the vast desert of
snow, ice, and rock. Suddenly he heard a sound like the
bark of a dog, and then something very like the report
of a gun. He shouted to Johansen, who called back that
he heard nothing. Nevertheless, Nansen resolved to go
in the direction of the sound, and find out what it was.
Off he started over the hummocks. After traveling some
distance he came upon the footprints of an animal. It
might have been the track of a fox or a wolf, but it looked
strangely like the track of a dog. Then Nansen distinctly
heard a dog barking in the distance. Very soon he heard
a human voice also. Wild with excitement and joy, he
mounted a hummock and shouted at the top of his
lungs.</p>

<p>An answering shout started him off at full speed in the
direction from which it came. Amid a sea of hummocks,
Nansen soon saw the figure of a man, followed by a dog.
The two men walked toward each other, waving their hats.
When they met they shook hands, and after they had
exchanged a few words the stranger looked sharply at
Nansen, and said, “Are you not Nansen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I am glad to meet you.”</p>

<p>The two shook hands again and again. The stranger
was Jackson, the English Arctic explorer, and his ship, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
<i>Windward</i>, was expected every day. Jackson told Nansen
that the land on which he stood was Franz Josef land.</p>

<p>Jackson then sent a man to bring Johansen to his camp,
and soon both he and Nansen were enjoying the comforts
of civilized life. After fifteen months of blubber and
bear meat, it was a welcome change to eat the food of
white men, to sleep in beds, to read newspapers and books,
and to have a change of clothing.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Nansen and Johansen should sail
with Jackson on the <i>Windward</i> for Norway. The ship
arrived July 26, and August 7, under a favorable wind, the
whole party embarked.</p>

<p>A pilot boarded the vessel when she reached the coast
of Norway, and when he found that Nansen was a passenger,
he was amazed. The pilot told Nansen that everybody
thought him dead, for the <i>Fram</i> had not been heard
from. Nansen assured him that the <i>Fram</i> was safe, for he
felt sure that Sverdrup would bring the vessel home.</p>

<p>Immediately after landing, Nansen and Johansen went
to a telegraph office, where they sent many dispatches, so
that the wonderful news of their return was soon received
over all parts of the civilized world.</p>

<p>Nansen had succeeded in reaching latitude 86° 14ʹ,
farther north than any other explorer had yet attained,
and had returned safely. Millions of people rejoiced, and
Nansen’s name was upon every tongue.</p>

<p>At Hammerfest, Nansen met his wife and Sir George
Baden-Powell, who had been on the point of sending out
an expedition in search of him. But Nansen’s heart was
heavy in the midst of all the rejoicing, for no news had
been heard from the <i>Fram</i>, and although he had perfect
confidence in Otto Sverdrup, he began to fear that harm
had befallen his brave comrades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>One morning he was awakened by Sir Baden-Powell
knocking at his door. “Come down immediately,” said
Sir Baden; “a man wishes to see you.” Nansen hurriedly
dressed and ran below.</p>

<p>There stood the manager of the telegraph office. The
manager handed Nansen a telegram, which he opened
with trembling fingers. It read as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Fram</i> arrived in good condition. All well on board.
Am going to Tromsö. Welcome home. O. S.”</p>
</div>

<p>Nansen nearly fainted with excitement and relief from
his terrible anxiety. Sir Baden shouted with joy. Johansen
smiled until his face looked like a full moon. As
soon as the good news of the <i>Fram’s</i> return became
known, the general rejoicing in Hammerfest spread to
all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Nansen’s daring expedition to the North had ended successfully,
and without the loss of a single life. Although
Nansen had not reached the pole, he had come within
two hundred and sixty-one miles of it. This was two
hundred miles nearer than any previous explorer had
penetrated. The theory of the southeast current was
proved to be correct, for the <i>Fram</i> had drifted into a
high latitude, and then out into the Atlantic between
Spitzbergen and Greenland. If the <i>Fram</i> had entered
the ice pack three hundred miles farther east, Nansen
believes that she would have drifted in a course parallel
to the one she actually followed. This course would have
carried her over the pole.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">XVIII. PEARY CROSSES GREENLAND<br />
<small>1891–1897</small></h2>
</div>


<p>While Nansen was busily exploring, Robert E. Peary, a
civil engineer in the United States Navy, determined to
make an attempt to cross the inland ice of Greenland.
Peary was making his plans for this journey when the
news came that Nansen had succeeded in crossing the ice
cap from the eastern coast of Greenland to the western.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this, Peary changed his plans and decided
to try to reach the northern point of Greenland overland.
This journey would take him across the inland ice by a
route much farther north than that taken by Nansen. It
would also enable Peary to discover whether Greenland
was a continent, as many supposed, or merely an island.</p>

<p>Funds for the trip were raised by private contribution
through the efforts of Lieutenant Peary’s friends, and on
June 6, 1891, the expedition sailed from Brooklyn on the
steamer <i>Kite</i>. Peary had already made one trip to Greenland,
and his friends waved their farewells cheerfully, feeling
certain that he would succeed in his undertaking.</p>

<p>After a pleasant voyage, the <i>Kite</i> reached Upernavik,
where she anchored. Peary hoped to secure the services
of an interpreter at this place, but he was unable to do so.
Soon the party set sail again, leaving behind them the
northernmost town on the globe. The <i>Kite</i> steamed
along for some time without meeting much ice, but when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
she entered Melville bay the pack closed round her, and
the 4th of July found the little vessel snugly frozen in.</p>

<p>Here she remained for a week, during which the average
temperature was about 31° F. On July 11, the ice
separated and the ship began to move. The engines
were started in a hurry. After forcing a passage through
a mass of thick ice, the ship was freed and proceeded on
her journey.</p>

<p>While the process of ramming the ice was going on,
Mr. Peary met with an accident. A large cake of ice
struck the rudder, tearing the wheel from the hands of the
two men on duty. Peary’s leg was caught between the
iron tiller and the house, and both bones snapped above
the ankle. The ship’s surgeon set the broken leg, and
Peary recovered rapidly. He was, however, unable to use
his leg for many weeks.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>Kite</i> ran into McCormick bay, where a site for a
house was selected. It was now about the middle of July,
and the short summer was at its height. The sun was
bright and warm, and the temperature about like that of
an April day in the temperate zone.</p>

<p>The ice still filled the bay, but narrow streams of water
trickled through in all directions, cutting the ice into great
pieces which rose and fell with the tide. Little brooks
ran down the mountains and through the valleys by the
side of great glaciers, while the snowbirds chirped and
twittered, enjoying the brief summer time.</p>

<p>The country around was bright with flowers. Tracks
of reindeer, foxes, and hares were repeatedly noticed, and
seals and walruses abounded, so that the party had no fear
of suffering for want of fresh meat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_135">
  <img src="images/i_135.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Setting Fox Traps.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The wood for the house was taken off the ship. In
order to insure warmth, the walls were made double, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
an air space of ten inches between the outer and inner
wall. The house was then covered with tarred paper, and
the inner walls lined with thick, red, Indian blankets. In
addition, a wind-break of stones, turf, empty barrels, and
boxes was built around the house. The dwelling was
roofed with canvas, and in the winter was to be banked
with snow. When the little building was completed, they
christened it Red Cliff House, because of the cliffs of sandstone
which rose behind it.</p>

<p>When the stores were safely stowed away within the
outer wall, the <i>Kite</i> steamed away home, leaving Peary,
with his wife and his assistants, to spend the winter
within seven hundred and forty miles of the North Pole.</p>

<p>Peary and his party were very comfortable and contented.
They enjoyed the crisp air and the bright sunshine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
and they liked to watch the beautiful blue-green
colors in the ice of the glaciers.</p>

<p>The men hunted, and secured numbers of reindeer skins
and furs of all sorts. They fished, and explored the surrounding
islands. While on these trips they sometimes
met Eskimos, who often accompanied them to Red Cliff
House. Some of the Eskimos came with their dog teams,
and Peary was always glad to buy the dogs from them.
By November 7 there were seventeen men, women, and
children at the camp, and Peary built a large snow hut for
them to live in.</p>

<p>Soon the long night began and all hunting came to an end.
Then the members of the party busied themselves preparing
for the great journey over the inland ice which Peary
intended to make in the spring. The reindeer skins were
stretched and dried and prepared for clothing by the
Eskimo women. In order to soften the skin so that it
could be used for clothing, the women folded it once with
the hair inside. Then they chewed it all along the edge
until the fold was made pliable. Another fold was then
made, and treated in the same manner. This process was
continued until the entire skin had been carefully chewed.
It was then scraped, and if necessary, the work was
repeated. It took two of Peary’s best workers about a
day to prepare a large buckskin. The teeth of the Eskimo
women are often worn down nearly to the gums by doing
this work.</p>

<p>Peary himself cut the patterns of the clothes and sleeping
bags, and the Eskimo women did the sewing. Peary’s
men busied themselves in trying to make sledges lighter
and stronger than anything they had yet found. They
fashioned ivory and horn braces for the sledges. Some of
the Eskimo men helped to make ivory rings for the dogs’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
harness. The Eskimo women chewed and sewed, and
everybody was busy and happy.</p>

<p>A large number of Eskimos visited Peary during the
winter, some coming from a distance of two hundred miles.
When the white men could not pronounce the queer names
of the Eskimos, they gave them nicknames. A certain trio
were known as the Priest, the Smiler, and the Villain.
The Villain was an entirely harmless Eskimo, whose chief
failing was his huge appetite.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, Peary invited his Eskimo friends to
dinner. After his own party had partaken of a remarkably
good Christmas feast, a fine venison stew was prepared
for the Eskimos. Dr. Cook, the ship’s surgeon, saw
that the guests were clean, to outward appearance at least,
and a jolly, happy party they were, sitting down at a civilized
dinner table for the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>The Eskimo men wore sealskin coats and bearskin
trousers, while the ladies appeared in foxskin jackets and
trousers. The Villain sat at the head of the table and
served the repast. The Daisy poured tea in Mrs. Peary’s
place, and conducted herself very gracefully.</p>

<p>Myah, who was called the white man, insisted upon
holding both his knife and spoon in his right hand, and
then using his fingers to carry the food to his mouth. He
was rude enough to stand up and try to harpoon some
choice pieces of meat from the stew with his fork. The
Villain reproved him so gravely that he stopped harpooning
and turned his attention to his own plate. It is barely
possible that the Villain was not shocked at the manners
of Myah, the white man, but that he wanted the choice
piece of meat himself.</p>

<p>After the stew they had coffee, candy, and raisins, and
then the Eskimos and the white men played games together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>Gradually the long night passed away, and at length it
was almost time for the sun to appear. Peary had ordered
an igloo to be built on the ice cap at an elevation of about
two thousand and fifty feet, so that he might use it when
he went up to see the sun rise.</p>

<p>When this igloo was completed, Peary, Dr. Cook, and
Astrup started out one morning, with provisions and sleeping
bags, in the hope of catching a first glimpse of the sun.
When they reached the igloo they were very tired. After
supper they took off their fur clothes, crawled into their
sleeping bags, and went to sleep. When Peary awoke, the
fine snow was drifting in his face, and the wind was blowing
a terrific gale. The entrance was blocked with snow,
and the three men were buried beneath the drifts.</p>

<p>Peary rolled himself out with great difficulty, and succeeded
in finding a shovel. Then he and Dr. Cook pulled
Astrup out, and the three men found themselves on top of
the drift under which the snow house was buried. They
were without shelter, two thousand feet above sea level,
while the storm was raging so fiercely that they had to
shout to one another in order to be heard.</p>

<p>After a while the snow turned to rain, which froze and
covered everything with ice. Their heavy outside clothes
were buried in the snow house, and they were clad only in
their under garments. If it had not been for the sleeping
bags, they would have frozen to death, and even as it was,
their condition was serious. But at length the storm ceased
and the half-frozen men succeeded in digging out their garments.
They were obliged to dress in the open air, with the
wind blowing and the thermometer standing at 3° above zero.</p>

<p>As soon as they were dressed they started for home, and
reached Red Cliff House in safety, warm with exercise.
Here, they were informed, the storm had likewise been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
terrific. The rain had fallen in torrents, washing away
the snow covering of the house and soaking through the
canvas roof. But Red Cliff House was stanchly built and
stood firm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_139">
  <img src="images/i_139.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Red Cliff House after the Storm.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The long Arctic night had passed away with the storm,
and the western sky was aflame with gorgeous colors;
brilliant yellow shaded into pale rose and green. Misty
lights of purple and green floated over the ice, and the
storm was forgotten in the beauty of the new day.</p>

<p>Now that the sun had made its appearance, Peary
decided to start on his white march over the ice cap. On
the last day of April three of the party, accompanied by
five Eskimos, left Red Cliff House with two sledges and
twelve dogs. Three days later Peary followed with one
man and a sledge drawn by eight dogs. In a few hours
he overtook his friends and proceeded with them as far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Humboldt glacier, where he asked for volunteers for the
long trip. All of the men were eager to accompany him,
but Astrup was chosen for his companion, and the rest of
the party returned to Red Cliff House.</p>

<p>Peary and Astrup now began their journey to the
northern end of Greenland. They slept during the day
and traveled by night, when the glare of the sun was
less trying to their eyes. Peary himself went first, leading
the way. He was followed by three of his best dogs,
harnessed to a light sledge which carried two hundred
pounds. These dogs had become so fond of Peary that
they tried always to keep as near him as possible. They
needed no driving or urging, but followed him into the
most dangerous places. In the rear came Astrup, with
ten dogs attached to the big sledge which carried the bulk
of the luggage.</p>

<p>Peary had thought himself on top of the ice cap at Humboldt
glacier, but he found that he must climb still higher.
As he ascended the weather became colder, and soon snow
began to fall. Worse than all, the large sledge broke down,
but Peary and Astrup mended it and kept on bravely. At
last the weather grew so cold that the snow froze hard, and
the two men were able to travel twenty miles a day.</p>

<p>For weeks Peary and Astrup marched over the great
ice, through snowstorms and furious wind. Whenever
fine weather came and the ice became firm and smooth,
they dashed along, forgetting the hardships they had
endured. At length Peary saw land in the distance.
Dark brown and red cliffs, precipices, valleys and mountains,
rivers and lakes, lay stretched out before them. The
dogs saw land also, and were as delighted as the men.</p>

<p>This land looked near, but it was not easy to reach.
Men and dogs slipped and scrambled down the ice crest,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
through slush and water, over sharp rocks, across streams,
and through valleys. The sun was very hot, and all the
travelers felt the change from the clear cold air of the
inland ice to the heat of the coast region.</p>

<p>The dogs especially suffered from the heat, and this
discomfort, together with their need of fresh meat, made
some of them ill. Pau, the leader of the team, seemed very
weak, and Peary feared that he would die. Pau was a very
brave dog, who had killed many polar bears. He must have
had some knowledge of magic; at any rate, he was an
expert in slipping his harness. Whenever he wished to, he
could slip out and away on a trip of his own in search
of food. When the other dogs saw Pau free, they tried to
break their harness and follow him, often with success.</p>

<p>One day Peary saw two black objects on the opposite
side of a valley. At first he thought they were large
rocks, but soon he became certain that they were musk-oxen.
Peary patted poor Pau’s head, as if to tell him that
he was going to try to get food for him. Pau seemed to
understand, for his eyes brightened and he wagged his tail.</p>

<p>Peary took his gun and started off in pursuit of the
musk-oxen. At last he came very near them, but so much
depended upon his success that he was seized with trembling.
It required a tremendous effort to point the gun
and pull the trigger. The enormous ox looked up curiously,
and walked toward the man, as if to see what the trouble
was. Peary then took aim, fired, and killed him. The
other musk-ox tried to run away, but Peary shot him also.</p>

<p>Astrup and the dogs were frantic with delight. Peary
patted each dog on the head when he returned, as if to
assure him of the feast he was to have. Soon the great,
shaggy musk-oxen were skinned and prepared for food,
and a huge hind quarter was carried to the dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The half-starved animals had a royal banquet, and for a
while nothing could be heard but the crunching of bones,
and now and then a deep growl. Pau brightened up and
took his place again as leader, seizing the largest piece of
meat without any interference from the other dogs.</p>

<p>Lion was the beautiful leader of the Cape York team.
His thick fur was snowy white, and his mane long and
shaggy. Lion knew as much about ice travel as Peary
himself, and he never got tangled in his traces or tried to
eat his harness. Upon this occasion, however, Lion actually
slipped harness. When Peary called him to have it
replaced, Lion obeyed instantly, crouching obediently at
his master’s feet.</p>

<p>While Peary was caring for the dogs, Astrup had fashioned
a fur couch from the hides of the musk-oxen, and
had broiled some delicious musk-ox steaks. That night
men and dogs fell asleep happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>After climbing over another slope, the company halted
on the edge of a high cliff, the northeastern point of Greenland.
Beyond the mainland they could descry islands in
the distance. An icebound channel marked the northern
boundary of Greenland. The large bay spreading out
before them Peary named Independence bay, in honor
of the day of discovery, July 4, 1892. The cliff was
called Navy cliff. A cairn was erected upon Navy cliff,
and the stars and stripes was unfurled.</p>

<p>Peary felt well repaid for his weary march. He had
succeeded in reaching latitude 81° 37ʹ 5ʺ north; he had
crossed the great ice cap, and had proved that Greenland
is an island; he had looked out upon the Arctic ocean
from a point of land never before reached by civilized
men; and he had gained a clear idea of the northern coast
of Greenland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>On the return trip Peary reduced the weight of the
packs by throwing away those articles which he did not
expect to need again. On the evening of July 7 the two
men began the climb up the slope to the inland ice. At
one time they were eight thousand feet above the level of
the sea. While they were upon a lofty elevation, a severe
storm kept them prisoners in a snowdrift for sixty hours.
Peary and Astrup slept most of the time. When the wind
died away and they crept out of the drift, dogs and sledges
had disappeared. These were soon dug out from the snow,
and the journey was resumed.</p>

<p>About this time Peary discovered, to his alarm, that a
quantity of his canned provisions had spoiled, and there
was danger that he might run short of food. The dogs,
too, seemed fagged and low-spirited. They pulled away
in a lifeless manner, with drooping tails and as if they
were utterly discouraged by this endless journey. So
many of them died that only five lived to reach home.
When these five dogs at last scented land, they were filled
with new life, and dashed merrily along down the slope
toward McCormick bay.</p>

<p>One day a number of black spots appeared on the white
surface of the snow. These spots proved to be people
from the <i>Kite</i>, which had arrived in the bay and was now
waiting to carry Peary and his party back to the United
States. Peary met the new arrivals joyfully, and soon
all were assembled at Red Cliff House. Great was the
rejoicing when Peary told of the success of his journey
over the inland ice.</p>

<p>The results of this great sledge journey of twelve hundred
miles across Greenland were very important. Greenland
was proved beyond dispute to be an island. Smaller
islands free from ice had been discovered north of Greenland.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
A large part of the inland ice had been traversed
and its character studied. The shores of Inglefield gulf
and Whale and Murchison sounds had been charted.
Many glaciers were discovered, and careful observations
made of the climate and tides. Considerable information
had been gained concerning a tribe of Eskimos called the
Arctic Highlanders, heretofore almost unknown.</p>

<p>In a few weeks preparations began for the return voyage.
During the latter part of the summer, Mr. and Mrs.
Peary and their companions bade farewell to Red Cliff
House, and sailed for home on the <i>Kite</i>. Together with
the members of the Red Cliff household who embarked on
the <i>Kite</i> were the five faithful dogs that had helped to
carry Peary to Independence bay and back again. Among
them were Pau and Lion.</p>

<p>The <i>Kite</i> stopped at Godthaab on her way southward,
and again at St. John’s, Newfoundland. From St. John’s
the vessel was detained by head winds, but at last the
Delaware breakwater was reached. A short distance
below Philadelphia the <i>Kite</i> was met by a tugboat, carrying
a party of Mr. Peary’s friends. They were soon on board
the <i>Kite</i>, listening to the wonderful story of the discoveries
and adventures of the Arctic travelers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_145">
  <img src="images/i_145.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Godthaab.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In 1893 Peary made another trip to North Greenland,
and this time remained two years and one month. He
made a second sledge journey of twelve hundred miles to
Independence bay, and surveyed a large area of the country
around Whale sound. During this trip, he also discovered
the great Cape York meteorites.</p>

<p>Meteorites are stones, largely composed of iron, which
fall to the earth from the heavens. They are supposed to
follow in the train of meteors, or shooting stars. These
pieces of meteoric iron differ from any kind of rock found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
upon the earth. They are covered with a thin, brownish
black crust, and look very different from the iron which we
obtain from mines. All meteorites are carefully preserved,
placed in museums, and studied.</p>

<p>Many Eskimos had already told Peary of the wonderful
iron mountain near Cape York, but up to this time he had
been too busy to search for it. Now he found an Eskimo
who promised to conduct him to the spot. This Eskimo
said that he would find three great pieces of iron, the
smallest about the size of a dog. One was near the water,
and the other two were upon the side of the mountain.</p>

<p>With fresh dogs Peary and the Eskimo were soon
galloping over hard ice toward Cape York. After a long
journey the Eskimo conducted Peary to the great brown
mass.</p>

<p>He told Peary that his people believed that the iron
mass had been an Eskimo woman, who with her dog and
her tent was hurled from the sky by the Evil Spirit. One
of the great piles used to look like the figure of a woman
in a sitting position, but the natives had chipped off many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
pieces of it and carried them away. They used these pieces
of iron for making knives and for harpoon points.</p>

<p>One tribe attempted to carry off the entire head. They
lashed it to a sledge and started for home, when suddenly
the sea rose with a loud noise, and the head disappeared
into the water, carrying the sledge and dogs with it. The
Eskimos barely escaped with their lives, and since that
time not the smallest fragment of the heavenly woman had
been disturbed.</p>

<p>Near the great mass of iron, called “the woman,” was
another, called “the dog.” About six miles south of these
was the third and largest, called “the tent.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_146">
  <img src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">The “Tent” Meteorite.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The coast where these meteorites were found is the
bleakest and most desolate region of the Arctic land.
Biting winds blow almost continuously, and iceberg after
iceberg drifts slowly past on its journey southward. It is
almost impossible for a vessel to reach this coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty and danger of the work,
Peary succeeded in bringing all of these meteorites to New
York. Those known as “the woman” and “the dog”
reached New York in 1895, and on October 2, 1897, the
<i>Hope</i> deposited the one known as “the tent” at the Brooklyn
navy yard. This weighs ninety tons and is the largest
known meteorite in the world.</p>

<p>Peary’s two trips across Greenland are classed among the
most brilliant geographical feats of recent years. His
efforts extended the exploration of the east coast of Greenland
two degrees.</p>

<p>In 1899 Peary again visited the Arctic regions. He
reached Fort Conger in March, 1900, and the next month,
with his colored servant, Matthew Henson, and five Eskimos,
started to explore the northern coast of Greenland.
He reached Cape Washington, where he erected a cairn,
and then pushing on, he rounded the northern limit of
the Greenland archipelago at latitude 83° 39ʹ north, from
which point the coast extended southward.</p>

<p>At this place, the most northerly known land in the
world, Peary built a cairn and inclosed records of his trip.
He then changed the direction of his course and turned
northward, traveling over sea ice toward the pole. He
proceeded in this direction until he reached latitude 83° 50ʹ
north, where he found it impossible to continue the journey
farther. He therefore returned to the Greenland coast,
and made explorations which enabled him to complete a
chart of the northern coast of that island. Upon the completion
of this work he returned to Fort Conger, arriving
there June 10, 1900, without accident or illness. During
this trip, the temperature ranged from 20° above to 35°
below zero.</p>

<p>The winter of 1900 and 1901 was spent at Fort Conger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
where game was plentiful. The men passed most of their
time hunting, and succeeded in slaying nearly two hundred
musk-oxen.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1901 Peary made a second attempt to
reach the pole, this time from the northern point of Grinnell
land, using Fort Conger as a base. But he was again
obliged to turn back. Still undismayed, Peary planned to
make another dash for the pole during the spring of 1902.
This expedition was also unsuccessful, and Peary returned
to the United States in the fall of 1902, without having
discovered the North Pole. But he accomplished valuable
geographical work, and has added greatly to our knowledge
of Greenland and Grinnell land.</p>

<p>Among the important results of Peary’s work are:—</p>

<p>First: The rounding of the northern limit of the Greenland
archipelago, the most northerly known land in the
world.</p>

<p>Second: The attainment of the highest latitude in the
Western Hemisphere, 83° 50ʹ north.</p>

<p>Third: The discovery of the character of the inland ice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">XIX. ANDRÉE’S BALLOON EXPEDITION TO
THE POLE<br />
<small>1897</small></h2>
</div>


<p>One of the most hazardous attempts to reach the pole
was that made by S. A. Andrée in his balloon. Andrée
was born in Sweden in 1854, and was carefully educated.
He became a mechanical engineer, and held an important
position under the Swedish government.</p>

<p>In 1876 he visited America to attend the Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia. While crossing the ocean he
noted the regularity of the trade winds, which led him to
believe that balloon voyages might be made across the
Atlantic. Some years later Andrée passed a winter in
Spitzbergen, directing experiments and observations in
atmospheric electricity. This scientific work strengthened
his belief that a balloon might be navigated through the air
in much the same manner as a ship through water.</p>

<p>From this time Andrée studied the construction of balloons
with great care, and in 1895 he astonished the world
by making known his plan to reach the North Pole by
means of an air route. He needed the sum of $36,000 in
order to carry out his project. This amount was generously
provided by King Oscar and two citizens of Sweden.</p>

<p>Then Andrée set about the work of having a balloon
constructed which would suit his purpose. He went to
Paris, and secured the services of the most noted balloon
maker in the world. This man built a balloon for Andrée<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
which was ninety-seven feet high by sixty-seven feet in
diameter. It was made of three thicknesses of silk, and
varnished over twice, inside and out. It was handled by
means of valves. The whole balloon was covered with a
network of hemp, ending in forty-eight suspension ropes,
to which the wooden bearing ring was attached.</p>

<p>The car, shaped like a cylinder and made of wicker, was
covered with tarpaulin, and was intended for rest and sleep.
The place for work and observation was a swinging gallery,
which also served for the roof of the car. In this gallery
the scientific instruments were kept. Andrée took with
him thermometers, barometers, cameras, and every sort of
needful apparatus. The car contained a sleeping bag, and
stores of books, maps, toilet articles, arms, and ammunition.
The balloon was built to carry three passengers. While
one slept, the other two expected to remain on the roof,
taking observations and guiding the balloon.</p>

<p>The bearing ring was the main storeroom. Crosspieces
of wood formed a floor, upon which many necessary articles
were packed. Boats, sledges, sails, ropes, and provisions
of all kinds were stored away in forty-eight large
sacks, which were hung to the bearing ring. Andrée had
provisions enough to last for nine months, and everything
was packed so as to occupy as little space as possible.</p>

<p>Three sails and three guide ropes were arranged to
aid in steering the balloon. The long guide ropes trailed
behind the balloon, serving the purpose of a rudder. The
sails caught the wind, increased the speed, and permitted
change of direction.</p>

<p>In 1896, the balloon and all the supplies were taken to
Dane’s island, near Spitzbergen, but as the desired south
wind did not blow, Andrée returned to Sweden. In May,
1897, Andrée and his companions again went to Dane’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
island. A balloon house was built, engines were set up
for producing hydrogen gas, and in due time the balloon
was inflated. By July 1 everything was ready.</p>

<p>Andrée and his two companions now waited anxiously
for a south wind, which they believed would blow them to
the North Pole. They waited ten days, until, on the morning
of July 11, 1897, a strong, steady wind from the south
was blowing.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement on Dane’s island when the
men began to tear down the house where the balloon was
imprisoned, and attach the car. At 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, July 11,
1897, Andrée and his two companions, Nils Strindberg
and Knut Fraenkel, jumped into the car, and gave orders
to cut the last ropes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_151">
  <img src="images/i_151.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Andrée begins his Journey.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Slowly the immense, airy structure rose to a height of a
few hundred feet, and sailed in a northerly direction out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
over Dane’s gate. Then it dropped suddenly, as if it had
received a current of air from above, and almost touched
the sea. Andrée threw out some sand bags, when the
balloon rose again to a height of about three thousand
feet, and sailed away in the same northerly direction.
About an hour after the start, it was lost to sight in the
clouds.</p>

<p>Some days later a carrier pigeon was shot in the rigging
of an Arctic schooner off Spitzbergen. The pigeon had
a message from Andrée tied under its wing. The message
was dated July 13, and stated that the balloon sailed
one hundred and forty-five geographical miles to the northward,
and then headed east. It had traveled forty-five
miles eastward when the pigeon was sent out.</p>

<p>From that day to this, no other message has been
received from Andrée. Andrée believed that his balloon
would float for six weeks, but the men who watched the
start, said that it lost much gas and much ballast before it
passed out of sight. They thought that it might have
floated about fifteen days. Two thirds of the guide ropes,
upon which Andrée depended for steering, were also lost
at starting. At first the balloon traveled about twenty-five
or thirty miles an hour. At this rate of speed, sailing
northward, Andrée should have reached the pole in less
than two days. But every ray of sunshine, every puff of
colder or warmer wind, cause a balloon to rise or fall, and
the methods of guiding and handling the delicate appliance
are not yet thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>No one knows what happened to the balloon after it rose
out of sight of the men on Dane’s island. For several
years Andrée’s friends refused to believe that he had
perished. They thought that he might be wandering
about in the Frozen North in the care of some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Eskimo tribes. Many stories have reached us from time
to time bearing upon the fate of Andrée, but upon investigation
they have all proved to be false. The only authentic
trace which has been found is a buoy picked up
northeast of Spitzbergen in 1899. This buoy was taken
to Sweden, and proved to be the one which Andrée had
taken with him for the purpose of dropping it, with a
letter, in case he crossed the pole. No letter was found,
but an anchor was attached to the buoy. This led to the
supposition that the buoy and anchor were thrown out to
lighten the balloon and keep it afloat a while longer, or
else that the balloon had been lost in the sea and the buoy
and anchor had drifted away.</p>

<p>It is now generally believed that Andrée and his two
companions lost their lives through the descent of the balloon
into the ocean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">XX. EXPEDITIONS OF 1902</h2>
</div>


<p>During the spring of 1902, several expeditions were at
work in the Northern regions, each hoping to be the first
to reach the pole.</p>

<p>One of the most important was the Ziegler-Baldwin
expedition, equipped by Mr. William Ziegler of New
York, and commanded by Mr. Evelyn Briggs Baldwin.
This was the largest and probably the best equipped
expedition sent out. Baldwin had two ships, four hundred
Eskimo dogs, and fifteen Siberian ponies. His flagship,
the <i>America</i>, was a stoutly built whaler and carried a
cargo of six hundred tons. His other ship, the <i>Fridtjof</i>,
carried the scientific instruments.</p>

<p>Through the generosity of Mr. Ziegler, practically perfect
scientific apparatus accompanied the expedition, and
Mr. Baldwin was assisted by experts in geographical charting,
geology, botany, and meteorology. Both the <i>America</i>
and the <i>Fridtjof</i> reached Franz Josef land, but very little
significant work was accomplished. Instead of wintering
in the North as had been planned, Mr. Baldwin returned
to Norway. Mr. Ziegler, however, has not faltered in his
determination to find the pole, and he has sent out another
expedition for that purpose which is now in the North.</p>

<p>A Russian expedition excited widespread interest. Admiral
Marakoff constructed an ice-breaking steamship, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
with it expected to force his way through the ice to the
pole. The steamer is called the <i>Ermack</i>, and is a very
powerful ship, able to stand fifteen times the strain which
may safely be brought to bear upon the average steel
ship. In breaking the ice, the <i>Ermack</i> rises upon it and
crushes it down. The forward propeller sucks away the
water underneath the ice, and thus reduces the resistance.</p>

<p>Admiral Marakoff believed that the ice near the pole
was thin, and that his ship would be able to steam directly
to that long-sought-for goal. But in battling against the
wide and heavy ice floes of the Arctic ocean, the <i>Ermack</i>
proved a failure. It is said, however, that she made five
successful trips between Nova Zembla and Franz Josef
land.</p>

<p>Another expedition, the progress of which was watched
with interest, was that of the Duke of Abruzzi, who is
cousin to the king of Italy. He started for the North
Pole in the <i>Stella Polare</i>, in 1899. In the spring of 1900,
he succeeded in arriving within 239.15 statute miles of the
pole. This record surpassed Nansen’s by twenty-three
miles, and is, therefore, the best yet made.</p>

<p>It is said that Abruzzi and Nansen will join in command
of an expedition which will start from Franz Josef land.
Both men have done valuable work in the icy North,
and important results are expected from their united
efforts.</p>

<p>Captain Bernier, a French Canadian, planned to enter
the Arctic by way of Bering strait. He expected then to
travel over the route taken by the <i>Jeannette</i>. Bernier
hoped to be carried near the pole by the ice drift. When
he had reached a suitable place, he intended to leave his
ship and proceed to the pole by means of dog sledges,
reindeer sledges, and boats. The newly invented system<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
of wireless telegraphy was to be used by Captain Bernier,
as a means of communication with his ship.</p>

<p>Captain Otto Sverdrup, in command of the <i>Fram</i>, was
already in the North in 1902. Sverdrup won his spurs,
you will remember, while on the famous Nansen expedition.
He was sent out by the Norwegian government to
explore the northern coast of Greenland, and to connect
Peary’s work on the east coast with that of a German
expedition on the west coast.</p>

<p>Robert Stein’s expedition had not the proper equipment
to seek the pole, but was designed for the exploration of
Ellesmere land. Stein returned without accomplishing
much valuable work.</p>

<p>A novel plan has been announced by Dr. Anschutz
Kampfe. Dr. Kampfe proposes to build a submarine
boat, and proceed to the pole beneath the ice.</p>

<p>For more than three hundred years, men have struggled
to reach the North Pole. They have braved bitter winds
and faced starvation and death, in order to wrest the secrets
of nature from the great white North.</p>

<p>Since Sir John Franklin’s first trip to the Arctic regions,
interest in the Frozen North has never flagged. Very grave
doubts as to the wisdom of spending so large sums of
money and of risking so many human lives have arisen
in the minds of those who have followed the story of suffering
and death. It is natural in this century, when men
are counting the cost of every project, to ask wherein lies
the advantage of exploring the polar country, since the
work is in every case so difficult, so dangerous, and in
many cases fatal. But we may feel sure that the work
will never cease until every part of the Frozen North is
known.</p>

<p>Beyond the additions to our store of meteorological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
knowledge, and of botanical and geological facts, there
has been a decided addition to the world’s wealth by Arctic
exploration: not in money, but in character; not in
conquest, but in heroism; not in material success, but in
those experiences which make men strong and enduring.
The world is already richer in mines and money than it is
in men of courage and in high acts of duty and bravery.
Thrilling deeds, glorious perseverance, and unwearied
patience are the noblest fruits of Arctic exploration.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">XXI. THE DISCOVERY OF THE NORTH POLE
BY ROBERT E. PEARY<br />
<small>1909</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The struggle to reach the North Pole was still waging.
Robert E. Peary was not a man to give up until he had
reached the goal. The Peary Arctic Club again gave him
financial assistance, and a vessel was constructed that
could be forced through dense ice. Theodore Roosevelt
was then President of the United States, and Commander
Peary called his ship the <i>Roosevelt</i>, because, as he said,
the name stood for strength and determination.</p>

<p>In June, 1905, he set sail, and reached the north coast
of Grant Land, where he spent the winter, and in the
spring he started northward with sledges and dogs. He
made his way to 87° 6ʹ on April 21, 1906. This was less
than two hundred miles from the Pole, and was the best
record as yet.</p>

<p>Even for the far North that season was unusually severe.
Violent winds and snowstorms separated the explorer
from his supply depots, and he was forced to return, killing
his dogs for food on the way. He was not discouraged,
for he felt that every failure gave him more
experience, which would enable him to achieve success
some day.</p>

<p>The Peary Arctic Club again helped him, and Zenas
Crane and many other public-spirited men sent donations
of money. The death of Morris K. Jesup was a severe
blow to him. Mr. Jesup had given him much support,
both by his belief in Peary’s ability to reach the Pole, and
by rendering financial aid to the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Peary in Arctic Costume.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>When, through the efforts of General Hubbard, president
of the Peary Arctic Club, the needed money was at
last procured, Peary completed his plans. He believed
that in order to reach the Pole he must adopt the manner
of life of the Eskimos. These natives of the Arctic zone
know how to travel over the icy seas with less discomfort
and danger than any other people.</p>

<p>Peary again, as in his previous expeditions, decided to
engage the hardy Eskimos from Whale Sound, with their
dogs, for the mainstay of his party, and to take with him
as few white men as possible. The expedition was thus
mostly made up of natives accustomed to the difficulties
and hardships of Arctic travel.</p>

<p>Then came the question of selecting the white men who
were to accompany him. The following were chosen:
Captain Robert A. Bartlett, as master of the <i>Roosevelt</i>;
George A. Wardwell, chief engineer; Dr. J. W. Goodsell,
surgeon; Matthew A. Henson, Peary’s negro assistant,
who had been with him on many Arctic voyages, an excellent
dog driver, and able to manage a sledge nearly as
well as the best Eskimo driver; Ross G. Marvin of Cornell,
Donald B. McMillan of Worcester, Mass., and George
Borup of Yale, as assistants.</p>

<p>On July 6, 1908, the expedition sailed from New
York on the <i>Roosevelt</i>, and July 17 from Sydney, Cape
Breton. At the start, the white members of the party
numbered twenty-two, and at Etah Peary found plenty of
Eskimos willing to go with him.</p>

<p>These Eskimos, known as the Whale Sound Eskimos,
are the most northerly race known. They migrate along
the coast from Cape York to Etah, and are remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
for their strength and endurance. From among them
Peary selected his company; here, also, he procured many
fine dogs, without whose help and service the Pole could
not have been reached.</p>

<p>The <i>Roosevelt</i> steamed northward from Etah, pushing
her way through the ice pack towards Cape Sheridan, on
the northern coast of Grant Land. During the trip the
Eskimo men were put to work making sledges and harness,
and the women began to make winter garments for
the men. There was much sewing to be done, for the
white men wore in winter just the same kind of clothing
that the Eskimos did.</p>

<p>McMillan, Borup, and Dr. Goodsell found amusement
in watching the women at their sewing. Sitting on the
ground or whatever is nearest, they take off their footgear
and put out one foot. Then holding one end of the material
between their toes, using the foot as a third hand,
they sew the seam away from them, instead of toward them
as our women do. It looked odd enough, but the spectators
had to admit that the work was done well. The Eskimos
sewed the furs and skins together so closely and skillfully
that the cold could not creep through.</p>

<p>These industrious women made stockings and mittens
of fur, boots of skins, trousers of skins of the polar bear,
jackets of deer or fox skin, and hoods of fur, finished
around the face with thick rolls of foxtails.</p>

<p>All were happy and comfortable for a while, but as they
advanced the ice became thicker and the ship was in great
danger. It took all Peary’s knowledge of the coast, and
all Bartlett’s skill in navigation, to keep the <i>Roosevelt</i> from
being crushed in the ice.</p>

<p>Every person on board, both whites and Eskimos, tied
his most necessary belongings into a bundle and stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
ready to jump over the side of the boat at a moment’s
notice in case the ship should be destroyed. But skill and
perseverance conquered, and the <i>Roosevelt</i> reached Cape
Sheridan in safety.</p>

<p>Here on the shore of the Arctic sea the party wintered,
spending their time in massing supplies at places farther
north, where they were likely to be needed later. Hunting
was good, musk oxen, bear, and deer were plentiful,
and large supplies of fresh meat were obtained. The men
of science took tidal and meteorological observations, and a
happy and busy winter was spent.</p>

<p>On October 12 the party said good-by to the sun; the
twilight darkened and the long Arctic night set in. Peary
did not wait for the sun to return, but as soon as it was
light enough to travel he renewed the journey to the Pole.</p>

    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Moonlight in the Arctic Regions.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On February 15, 1909, the first detachment of the sledge
party under Captain Bartlett left Cape Sheridan for Cape
Columbia, the most northern point of Grant Land. The
other detachments followed on successive days, and on
February 22, Peary started the last of all. From Cape
Columbia he planned to travel directly north over the ice
of the Polar sea for a distance of four hundred and thirteen
geographical miles. This would take him to 90° north latitude,
<i>i.e.</i>, to the North Pole.</p>

<p>By traveling in detachments a path once opened was
kept open. The first detachment accomplished the difficult
work of breaking a way through the ice, the second detachment
found travel easier, and the third found it still
easier. Thus the strength both of the men and the dogs
of the last detachment was saved for the final march.</p>

<p>The party was to return by the same route as the one they
advanced by, the supporting parties keeping the trail open
for the rapid return of the main party. They were also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
able to use many of the same igloos in returning, so that
the labor of building them was avoided and the strength
of the men economized. The plan of march resembled
that of a relay race, with which all girls and boys are
familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>The entire sledge party on leaving the ship numbered
seven whites, nineteen Eskimos, one hundred and forty
dogs, and twenty-eight sledges. On March 1, 1909, Bartlett’s
party left land, setting out over the sea ice for the
north, the distance from the mainland to the Pole being
four hundred and seventy-five statute miles.</p>

<p>Think of starting on a journey of that length on foot
with no certainty of even necessary food, and over a rough
expanse of ice and snow. These brave men never faltered.
As the party drew near the Pole, the supporting detachments
were sent back one after another. The last detachment
sent back was that under Captain Bartlett, who had
given such valuable assistance in leading the pioneer party.</p>

<p>Peary felt sorry to part with Captain Bob, as he familiarly
called him, and Captain Bob was sorry in his turn
to go. He had reached 87° 47ʹ north latitude, and was
nearer to the North Pole than any other explorer had yet
been. It had been his ambition to reach 88°, but there was
no time to spare, and though disappointed, he obeyed his
commander cheerfully, like a good soldier. He had surpassed
the Italian record by one degree and a quarter.</p>

<p>Peary was now left with only five companions,—Matt
Henson, his colored servant, and four Eskimos; he also
had forty dogs and five sledges. He was one hundred and
thirty-three nautical miles from the Pole, and he planned
to make five marches of at least twenty-five miles each, and
then cover the remaining distance by pushing on with a
light sledge and a double team of dogs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_167">

  <div class="caption">
    <div class="right"><small>From “Fighting the Polar Ice,” copyright by Anthony Fiala.</small></div>
    <p class="noic"><span class="smcap">Eskimo Dogs.</span></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After a rest and some repairing of the sledges the little
party started northward. The sun shone brightly out of a
deep blue sky, and a finer morning for the journey could
not be imagined. Except for some pressure ridges which
were nearly fifty feet in height, the ice was hard and level.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
The ridges corresponding to hills on land were not as hard
to pass over as were the leads of water which Peary had
met with before during the journey.</p>

<p>With weather in their favor the party made great progress.
In one march of twelve hours thirty miles were
covered. As they neared the Pole, the wind grew bitterly
cold. Even the Eskimos complained of it, and said that
their noses would freeze. This was unusual, for the nose
of an Eskimo is supposed to be so hardy that no frosty
winds could freeze it. But all soon forgot the cold in their
joy in drawing near the Pole.</p>

<p>On April 6, 1909, at ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the last march ended, and
Peary found by his observations that he had arrived at
89° 57ʹ north latitude. Here the party camped, and Peary
called the place Camp Morris K. Jesup in honor of the man
who had done so much to further discoveries in the Arctic
regions.</p>

<p>From Camp Jesup, Peary traveled on about ten miles
beyond the Pole, crossing and recrossing in several directions
over a radius of ten miles. Strange were his feelings
when he stood at the place where north, east, and west
were eliminated, and every direction was south. He was
also at a place where there is in the year but one night and
one day, each six months in length. The stars circle round
overhead during the night and the sun during the day.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach was a vast, white expanse
of ice. No living creature was to be seen, no sign of life
anywhere, only a great silence, a great whiteness, and
dazzling sunlight. Peary placed the American flag in the
ice. The Eskimos and Henson gave three cheers, and all
shook hands.</p>

<p>The Eskimos did not understand what made Peary so
happy, but they did know that he had succeeded in reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
a wonderful spot, which he had searched for during
many years.</p>

<p>Thirty hours were spent at the Pole taking observations
and photographs. The maximum temperature was -12°
and the minimum was -30° Fahrenheit. Peary put records
of his journey and a piece of the American flag in a glass
bottle, and wedged it in between blocks of ice and left it.
As the ice is constantly shifting and changing its position,
it is hard to tell where this bottle may drift.</p>

<p>The ice at the Pole was too thick for Peary to measure
the depth of the ocean. But on returning he found a
place, five miles from the Pole, where the ice was thinner.
He succeeded in making a hole with a pickax and dropped
his sounding lead. The wire ran out to a depth of fifteen
hundred fathoms (nine thousand feet) without touching
bottom. Then the wire broke, and it and the lead were
lost. We do not know how much deeper the Polar ocean
may be.</p>

<p>The return journey to land was made by forced marches
of about twenty-nine and a half miles a day. This speed
was made possible by the lighter sledge loads, and the fact
that they were retracing their steps over a trail kept partially
open by the other detachments. But the Eskimos
said, “The devil is asleep, or we never should have come
back so easily!” Peary knew that they came back easily
because of favorable weather and ice conditions, and because
his plans had been wise.</p>

<p>When the party came in sight of the <i>Roosevelt</i> again, the
joy of the men cannot be described. Captain Bartlett saw
them and went out to meet them. His face was sad, and
Peary felt that he was to hear some bad news. Bartlett
then told him of the death of Marvin by drowning
while on his return march. Peary felt keenly the loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
of his brave companion who had accomplished so much
valuable work, and who had made himself respected and
loved.</p>

<p>All the members of the party resumed their duties, and
the first was to reward the faithful Eskimos who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
worked and served so well. Peary gave them hatchets,
knives, shot-guns, rifles, and tools of all kinds. They were
much pleased and felt as rich as millionaires.</p>

<p>As soon as the ice permitted, the <i>Roosevelt</i> left her winter
quarters and sailed southward, stopping at Etah and
Cape York, and arriving at Sydney, Cape Breton, September
21, 1909, where she received an enthusiastic welcome.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1909, while Peary and his party were
still in the north, the world was startled by a telegraphic
message from a Danish steamer, saying: “We have on
board the American traveler, Dr. Cook, who reached the
North Pole, April 21, 1908.”</p>

<p>The next morning the <cite>New York Herald</cite> published an
account of the great discovery cabled by Cook himself. It
said that he had reached the Pole on the date just mentioned,
and that “it was a cheerless spot, an endless field
of purple snows.” Two days later Dr. Cook landed at
Copenhagen and was greeted with cheers, and great honors
were bestowed upon him.</p>

<p>Two days later another telegram was received by the
Associated Press of New York, which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Stars and stripes nailed to the North Pole.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Peary.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>There was great excitement all over the civilized world.
Messages continued to arrive from Peary fixing the date
of his arrival at the Pole, April 6, 1909. Cook claimed to
have reached the pole a year earlier, April 21, 1908. Why
had he kept silent so long? Discussion grew, and scientists
demanded proof and data from both men.</p>

<p>The records of Dr. Cook were submitted to the University
of Copenhagen, and their final report was made
public December 21, 1910. It declared that the papers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
and documents submitted to it by Dr. Cook contained no
observations or explanations to prove that Dr. Cook had
reached the Pole.</p>

<p>That Peary reached the Pole was never doubted. The
National Geographical Society after careful examination of
his records reported that they were unanimous in the
opinion that Commander Peary reached the North Pole,
April 6, 1909.</p>

<p>The following resolutions were adopted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Whereas</em>, Commander Robert E. Peary has reached
the North Pole, the goal sought for centuries, and</p>

<p><em>Whereas</em>, this is the greatest geographical achievement
that this society can have opportunity to honor, therefore</p>

<p><em>Resolved</em>, that a special medal be awarded to Commander
Peary.”</p>
</div>

<p>Medals and honors were bestowed upon him by many
scientific societies at home and abroad, and he was promoted
to the rank of Rear Admiral in the United States
Navy, and given the thanks of Congress.</p>

<p>The Frozen North has given up its secret. Man’s persistence
has conquered, and 90° north has been attained.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Peary and all the brave men, who for
nearly four hundred years struggled to reach the North
Pole, will be held in honor by their countrymen for all
time.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
